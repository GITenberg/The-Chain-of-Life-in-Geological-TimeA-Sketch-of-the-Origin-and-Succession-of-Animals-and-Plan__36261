  <h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p><span class="smcap">Questions</span> as to the origin and history of life are not at the
  present time answered by mere philosophical speculation and
  poetical imagining. Such solutions of these questions as science
  can profess to have obtained are based on vast accumulations of
  facts respecting the remains of animals and plants preserved in
  the rocky beds of the earth&rsquo;s crust, which have been
  successively accumulated in the course of its long geological
  history. These facts undoubtedly afford the means of attaining to
  very certain conclusions on many points relating to the history
  of life on the earth. But, on the other hand, they have furnished
  the material for hypotheses which, though confidently affirmed to
  be indisputable, have no real foundation in nature, and are
  indirectly subversive of some of the most sacred beliefs of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances it is most desirable that those who are
  not specialists in such matters should be in a position to judge
  for themselves; and it does not appear impossible in the actual
  state of knowledge, to present, in terms intelligible to the
  general reader, such a view of the ascertained sequence of the
  forms of life as may serve at once to give
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span> exalted
  and elevating views of the great plan of creation, and to prevent
  the deceptions of pseudo-scientists from doing their evil work.
  Difficulties, no doubt, attend the attempt. They arise from the
  number and variety of the facts, from the uncertainties attending
  many important points, from the new views constantly opening up
  in the progress of discovery, and from the difficulty of
  presenting in an intelligible form the preliminary data in
  biology and geology necessary for the understanding of the
  questions in hand. In order, as far as possible, to obviate these
  difficulties, the plan adopted in this work has been to note the
  first known appearance of each leading type of life, and to
  follow its progress down to the present time or until it became
  extinct. This method is at least natural and historical, and has
  commended itself to the writer as giving a very clear
  comprehension of the actual state of our knowledge, and as
  presenting some aspects of the subject which may be novel and
  suggestive even to those who have studied it most deeply.</p>

  <p>In selecting examples and illustrations, the writer has
  endeavoured to avoid, as far as possible, those already familiar
  to the general reader. He has carefully sought for the latest
  facts, while rejecting as unproved many things that are
  confidently asserted; and has endeavoured to avoid all that is
  irrelevant to the subject in hand, and to abstain from all
  technical terms not absolutely essential. In a work at once so
  wide in its scope, so popular in its character, and so limited in
  its dimensions, a certain amount of hostile criticism on the part
  of specialists is to be expected, some portion of it perhaps
  just, other portions arising from narrow prejudices due to
  limited lines of study. The writer is willing to
  receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id=
  "Page_vii">vii</a></span> such comments with attention and
  gratitude, but he would deprecate the misuse of them in the
  interest of those coteries which are at present engaged in the
  effort to torture nature into a confession of belief in the
  doctrines of a materialistic or agnostic philosophy.</p>

  <p>The title of the work was suggested by that of Gaudry&rsquo;s
  recent attractive book, <i>Les Encha&icirc;nements du Monde
  animal</i>. It seemed well fitted to express the connection and
  succession of forms of life, without implying their derivation
  from one another, while it reminds us that nature is not a
  fortuitously tangled skein, and that the links which connect man
  himself with the lowest and oldest creatures bind him also to the
  throne of the Eternal.</p>

  <p>In the few years that have elapsed since the publication of
  the first edition of this work, great additions have been made to
  our knowledge of fossil animals and plants. Many new species have
  been described, and many new facts have been discovered,
  respecting species previously known. This rapid progress of
  discovery has, however, invalidated few of the statements made in
  the first edition, and has certainly established nothing against
  the general laws of the succession of life as stated in this
  work.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most interesting phase of recent discovery is the
  tracing back of certain forms of life to earlier periods of the
  earth&rsquo;s geological history. Some of the most recent facts
  of this kind are the finding, by M. Charles Brongniart, of a
  fossil insect, allied to the <i>Blattae</i> or cockroaches, in
  the Silurian of Spain, that of true Scorpions in the Upper
  Silurian of Sweden by Lindstr&ouml;m, and in the Upper Silurian
  of Scotland by Peach, who has also described fossil Millipedes
  from the Lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id=
  "Page_viii">viii</a></span> Devonian. The tendency of such
  discoveries is to carry farther back the origin of highly
  specialised forms of life, and thus to render less probable their
  origin by any process of gradual derivation.</p>

  <p>Other discoveries serve to fill up blanks in our knowledge,
  and thus to render the geological record less imperfect. Of this
  kind is the close approximation now worked out in Western America
  between the end of the reign of the great Mesozo&iuml;c reptiles
  and the beginning of that of the mammals of the Tertiary&mdash;a
  great and abrupt revolution, effected apparently by a <i>coup de
  main</i>. I have myself had opportunity to show that a similarly
  sharp line separates that quaint old Mesozo&iuml;c flora of
  pines, cycads and ferns, which extends upward into the Lower
  Cretaceous, from the rich and luxuriant assemblage of
  broad-leaved trees of modern aspect, which takes its place in the
  middle part of the same formation.</p>

  <p>It is not too much to say that these and similar discoveries,
  while they serve to bridge over gaps in the succession of organic
  beings, do not favour the theory of slow modification of types.
  They rather point to a law of rapid development of new forms
  under special conditions as yet unknown to science, and this
  accompanied with the extinction of older species. Recent
  discoveries also present many remarkable instances of the early
  introduction of highly specialised types, of higher forms
  preceding those that are lower in the same class, and of the
  persistence of certain types throughout geological time without
  any important change.</p>

  <h1>THE CHAIN OF LIFE.</h1>
  <hr />

  <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">preliminary considerations as to the
  extent and sources of our knowledge.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/icap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "I" /><span class="smcap">t</span> is of the nature of true
  science to take nothing on trust or on authority. Every fact must
  be established by accurate observation, experiment, or
  calculation. Every law and principle must rest on inductive
  argument. The apostolic motto, &ldquo;Prove all things, hold fast
  that which is good,&rdquo; is thoroughly scientific. It is true
  that the mere reader of popular science must often be content to
  take that on testimony which he cannot personally verify; but it
  is desirable that even the most cursory reader should fully
  comprehend the modes in which facts are ascertained and the
  reasons on which conclusions are based. Failing this, he loses
  all the benefit of his reading in so far as training is
  concerned, and cannot have full assurance of that which he
  believes. When, therefore, we speak of life-epochs, or of links
  in a chain of living beings, the question is at once
  raised&mdash;What evidence have we of the succession of such
  epochs? This question, with some accessory points, must engage
  our attention in the present chapter.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id=
  "Page_2">2</a></span>Geology as a practical science consists of
  three leading parts. The first and most elementary of these is
  the study of the different kinds of rocks which enter into the
  composition of those parts of the earth which are accessible to
  us, and which we are in the habit of calling the crust of the
  earth. This is the subject of <i>Lithology</i>, which is based on
  the knowledge of minerals, and has recently become a much more
  precise department of science than heretofore, owing to the
  successful employment of the microscope in the investigation of
  the minute structure and composition of rocks. The second is the
  study of the arrangement of the materials of the earth on the
  large scale, as beds, veins, and irregular masses; and inasmuch
  as the greater part of the rocks known to us in the earth&rsquo;s
  crust are arranged in beds or strata, this department may be
  named <i>Stratigraphy</i>. A more general name sometimes employed
  is that of <i>Petrography</i>. The third division of geology
  relates to the remains of animals and plants buried in the rocks
  of the earth, and which have lived at the time when those rocks
  were in process of formation. These fossil remains introduce us
  to the history of life on the earth, and constitute the subject
  of <i>Pal&aelig;ontology</i>.</p>

  <p>It is plain that in considering what may be learned as to
  epochs in the history of life we are chiefly concerned with the
  last of these divisions. The second may also be important as a
  means of determining the relative ages of the fossils. With the
  first we have comparatively little to do.</p>

  <p>Previous to observation and inquiry, we might suppose that the
  kinds of animals and plants which now inhabit the earth are those
  which have always peopled it; but a very little study of fossils
  suffices to convince us that vast numbers of creatures once
  inhabitants of this world have become extinct, and can be known
  to us only by their remains buried in the earth. When we place
  this in connection with stratigraphical facts, we further find
  that these extinct species have succeeded each other at different
  times, so as to constitute successive dynasties<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> of life. On
  the one hand, when we know the successive ages of fossil forms,
  these become to us, like medals or coins to the historian,
  evidences of periods in the earth&rsquo;s history. On the other
  hand, we are obliged in the first instance to ascertain the ages
  of the medals themselves by their position in the successive
  strata which have been accumulated on the surface. The series of
  layers which explorers like Schliemann find on the site of an
  ancient city, and which hold the works of successive peoples who
  have inhabited the place, thus present on a small scale a
  faithful picture of the succession of beds and of forms of life
  on the great earth itself.</p>

  <p>Our leading criterion for estimating the relative ages of
  rocks is the superposition of their beds on each other. The beds
  of sandstone, shale, limestone, and other rocks which constitute
  the earth&rsquo;s crust have nearly all been deposited thereon by
  water, and originally in attitudes approaching to horizontality.
  Hence the bed that is the lower is the older of any two beds.
  Hence also, when any cutting or section reveals to us the
  succession of several beds, we know that fossil remains contained
  in the lower beds must be of older date.</p>

  <p>We can scarcely walk by the side of a stream which has been
  cutting into its banks, or at the foot of a sea-cliff, or through
  a road-cutting, without observing illustrations of this. For
  instance, in the section represented in <a href="#f1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>, we see at
  the surface the vegetable soil, below this layers of gravel and
  sand, below this a bed of clay, and below this hard limestone. Of
  these beds <i>a</i> is the newest, <i>d</i> the oldest; and if,
  for example, we should find some marine shells in <i>d</i>, some
  freshwater shells in <i>c</i>, bones of land animals and flint
  arrowheads in <i>b</i>, and fragments of modern pottery in
  <i>a</i>, we should be able at once to assign their relative ages
  to these fossils, and to form some idea of the succession of
  conditions and of life which had occurred in the locality.</p>

  <p>On a somewhat larger scale, we have in <a href="#f2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a> a section
  of the beds cut through by the great Fall of Niagara. All
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
  these except that marked <i>a</i> are very ancient marine rocks,
  holding fossil shells and corals, but now forming part of the
  interior of a continent, and cut through by a fresh-water
  river.</p>

  rock salt near Goderich in Canada. Here we have a succession of
  1,500 feet of beds, some of which must have been formed under
  very peculiar and exceptional conditions. The beds of rock salt
  and gypsum must have been formed by the drying up of sea-water in
  limited basins. Those of Dolomite<span class='pagenum'><a name=

  <p>In <a href="#f4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a> we have a bed of coal and its accompaniments.
  The coal itself was produced by the slow accumulation of
  vegetable matter on a water-soaked soil, and this was buried
  under successive beds of sand and clay, now hardened into
  sandstone and shale, some of the beds holding trees and reed-like
  plants, which still stand on the soils on which they grew, and
  which must have been buried in sediment deposited in inundations
  or after subsidence of the land. In this section we may also
  observe that the beds are somewhat inclined; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> and that this
  is not their original position is shown by the posture of the
  stems of trees, once erect, but now inclined with the beds. This
  leads to a consideration very important with reference to our
  present subject; namely, that as our continents are mostly made
  up of beds deposited under water and afterwards elevated, these
  beds have in this process experienced such disturbances that they
  rarely retain their horizontal position, but are tilted at
  various angles. When we follow such inclined strata over large
  areas, we find that they undulate in great waves or folds,
  forming what are called anticlinal and synclinal lines, and that
  the irregularities of the surface of the land depend to a great
  extent on these undulations, along with the projection of hard
  beds whose edges protrude at the surface. In point of fact, as
  shown in <a href="#f5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>, mountain ranges depend on these crumplings
  of the earth&rsquo;s crust; and the primary cause of these is
  probably the shrinkage of the mass of the earth owing to
  contraction in cooling. When the disturbances of beds are
  extreme, they often cause intricacies of structure difficult to
  unravel; but when of moderate extent they very much aid us in
  penetrating below the surface, for we can often see a great
  thickness of beds rising one from beneath another, and can thus
  know by mere superficial examination the structure of the earth
  to a great depth. It thus happens that geologists reckon the
  thickness of the stratified <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> deposits of the crust of the
  earth at more than 70,000 feet, though they cannot penetrate it
  perpendicularly to more than a fraction of that depth. The two
  sections, <a href="#f6">Figs.&nbsp;6 and 7</a>, showing the sequence of beds in England
  and in the northern part of North America, will serve, if studied
  by the reader, to show how, by merely travelling over the surface
  and measuring the upturned edges of beds, many thousands of feet
  of deposits may be observed, and their relative ages distinctly
  ascertained.</p>

  beds.</p>

  <p>In studying any extensive section of rock we find that its
  members may more or less readily be separated into distinct
  groups. Sometimes these are distinguished by what is termed
  unconformability, that is, the lower series has been disturbed or
  inclined before the upper has been deposited upon it. This is
  seen on a grand scale in the section <a href="#f7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>, in the case of
  the Laurentian and Cambrian formations, and on a smaller scale in
  <a href="#f8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a> in the unconformable superposition of Devonian
  conglomerate on Silurian slates at St. Abb&rsquo;s Head. In the
  last section it is quite evident that the beds of the lower
  series have been bent into abrupt folds and worn away to a
  considerable extent before the deposition of the overlying
  series. In such a case we know not merely that the upper series
  is newer than the lower, but that some considerable time must
  have elapsed after the deposition of the one before the other was
  laid down; and we are not surprised to find that the fossils in
  the groups thus unconformable to each other are very
  different.</p>

  <p>But even when the beds are conformable, they can usually be
  separated into groups, depending upon differences of mineral
  character, or changes which have occurred in the mode of
  deposition. One group of beds, for example, may be largely
  composed of limestone, another of sandstone or shale. One group
  may be distinguished by containing some special mineral, as, for
  example, rock salt or coal, while others may be destitute of such
  special minerals. One group may show by its fossils that it was
  deposited in the sea, others may be estuarine or <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">9<br />
  10</a></span>lacustrine. Thus we obtain the means of dividing the
  rocks of the earth into groups of different ages, known as
  &ldquo;Formations,&rdquo; and marking particular periods of
  geological time. By tracing these formations from one district or
  region to another, we learn the further truth that the succession
  is not merely local, but that, though liable to variation in
  detail, its larger subdivisions hold so extensively that they may
  be regarded as world-wide in their distribution.</p>

  <p>Putting together the facts thus obtained, we can frame a
  tabular arrangement of the earth&rsquo;s strata, as in the table
  prefixed to this chapter; and when we add the further discovery,
  very early made by geologists, that the successive formations
  differ from each other in their fossil remains, we have the means
  of recognising any particular formation by its fossils, even when
  the stratigraphical evidence may be obscure or wanting. Thus our
  knowledge of Epochs of Life, and indeed of the whole geological
  history of the earth, is based on the superposition of beds in
  the earth&rsquo;s crust, and on the diversity of fossil remains
  in the successive beds so superimposed on each other; and it is
  on these grounds that we are enabled to construct a Table of
  Geological Formations representing the whole series of beds as
  far as known, with the characteristic groups of fossils of each
  period. Here I might close these preliminary considerations, but
  there are a few accessory questions, important to our clear
  comprehension of the subject, which may profitably occupy our
  attention for a short time.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id=
  "Page_11">11</a></span>One of these relates to the absolute
  duration of the time represented by the geological history of the
  earth. Such estimates as our present knowledge enables us to form
  are very indefinite. Whether we seek for astronomical or
  geological data, we find great uncertainty. To such an extent is
  this the case, that current estimates of the time necessary to
  bring the earth from a state of primitive incandescence to its
  present condition have varied from fifteen millions of years to
  five hundred millions. Of the various modes proposed, perhaps the
  most satisfactory as well as instructive is that based on the
  rate of denudation of our present continents, as indicated by the
  amount of sediment carried down by great rivers. The Mississippi,
  draining a vast and varied area in temperate latitudes, is
  washing away the American land at the rate of one foot in 6,000
  years. The Ganges, in a tropical climate and draining many
  mountain valleys, works at the rate of one foot in 2,358 years.
  The mean of these two great rivers would give one foot in 4,179
  years, at which rate our continents would be levelled with the
  waters in about six millions of years. But the land has been in
  process of renewal as well as of waste in geological time; and a
  better measure will be afforded by the amount of beds actually
  deposited. The entire thickness of all the stratified rocks of
  Great Britain has been calculated by Ramsay at 72,000 feet. Now,
  if we suppose the waste in all geological time to have been on
  the average the same as at present, and that this material has
  been deposited to the thickness of 72,000 feet on a belt of sea
  margin 100 miles in width, we shall have about 86 millions of
  years as the time required.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
  "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
  This has the merit of approximating to Sir William
  Thomson&rsquo;s calculation, based on the rate of cooling of the
  earth, that a minimum of 100 millions of years may represent the
  time since a solid crust first began to form. As it is more
  likely that the rate of denudation has on <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>the average
  been greater in former geological periods than at present, we may
  perhaps estimate fifty or sixty millions of years as the time
  required for the accumulation of all our formations. Some
  geologists object to this as too little, but in this some of them
  are influenced by the exigencies of theories of evolution, and
  others appear to have no adequate conception of the vast lapse of
  time represented by such numbers, in its relation to the actual
  rates of denudation and deposition.</p>

  <p>It should be mentioned here, however, that, on certain
  theories now somewhat generally accepted, respecting the nature
  and source of solar heat, the absolute duration of geological
  time would be much reduced below the estimate of Sir Wm. Thomson.
  Prof. Tait has based on such data an estimate of fifteen millions
  of years. Prof. Simon Newcomb says that &ldquo;on the only
  hypothesis science will now allow us to make respecting the
  source of the solar heat&rdquo; (the gravitation hypothesis of
  Helmholtz) &ldquo;the earth was, twenty millions of years ago,
  enveloped in the fiery atmosphere of the sun.&rdquo; Dr. Kirkwood
  has called attention to these results in connection with the
  planetary hypothesis of La Place, in the <i>Proceedings of the
  American Philosophical Society</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
  "FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
  Should such views prove to be well-founded, geological
  calculations as to the time required for the successive
  formations may have to be revised.</p>

  <p>If now we attempt to divide this time among the formations
  known to us, according to their relative thicknesses, we have,
  according to an elaborate estimate of Professor Dana, the time
  ratios of 12, 3, and 1 for the Pal&aelig;ozoic, Mesozoic, and
  Cainozoic periods respectively. Taking the whole time since the
  beginning of the Cambrian as forty-eight millions of years, we
  should thus have for the Pal&aelig;ozoic thirty-six millions, for
  the Mesozoic nine, and for the Tertiary three. Another
  calculation, recently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id=
  "Page_13">13</a></span>made by Professors Hull and Haughton,
  gives the following ratios:&mdash;</p>

  <table width="60%" summary="time ratios">
    <tr>
      <td class="left60">Azoic</td>

      <td class="left40">34&middot;3 per cent.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="left60">Pal&aelig;ozoic</td>

      <td class="left40">
      42&middot;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="left60">Mesozoic and Cainozoic</td>

      <td class="left40">
      23&middot;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>This calculation is, however, based on the absolute thickness
  of the several series as ascertained in Great Britain, without
  reference to the nature of the beds, as indicating different
  rates of accumulation. Under either estimate it will be seen that
  the Pal&aelig;ozoic time greatly exceeds the Mesozoic and
  Cainozoic together, and consequently that changes of life seem to
  have proceeded at an accelerated rate as time wore on.</p>

  <p>Another inquiry of some importance relates to the manner of
  preservation of fossils, and the extent to which they constitute
  the material of rocks. This inquiry is doubly important, as it
  bears on the genuineness of fossil remains, and on the means we
  have of understanding their nature.</p>

  <p>Some rocks are entirely made up of matter that once was alive,
  or formed part of living organisms. This is the case with some
  limestones, which consist of microscopic shells, or of larger
  shells, corals, and similar calcareous organisms, either entire
  or broken into fragments and cemented together with pasty or
  crystalline limestone filling their interstices. This may be seen
  in <a href="#f9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>, which represents a magnified slice of a Silurian
  limestone. Coal in like manner consists of carbonised vegetable
  matter, retaining more or less perfectly its organic structure,
  and sometimes even the external forms of its constituent parts.
  More frequently, fossils are dispersed more or less sparsely
  through the substance of beds composed of earthy matter; and they
  have usually been more or less affected by chemical changes, or
  by mechanical pressure, or are mineralised by different
  substances which have either filled their pores by infiltration
  or have more or less completely replaced their substance. Of
  course, as a rule, the softer and more putrescible organic
  matters have perished by decay, and it is only the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> harder and
  more resisting parts that remain. Even these have often yielded
  to the enormous pressure to which they have been subjected, and
  if at all porous, have been changed by the slow action of
  percolating water charged with various kinds of mineral matter in
  solution.</p>

  Wall silicified, cell filled with silica.</p>

  <p>It thus happens that many fossils are infiltrated with mineral
  matter. Wood, for example, may have the cavities of its cells and
  vessels filled with silica or silicates, with sulphide or
  carbonate of iron, or with limestone, while the woody walls of
  the cells may remain either as coaly matter or charcoal. I have
  often seen the microscopic cells of fossil wood not only filled
  in this way, but presenting under a high power successive coats
  of deposit, like the banded structure of an agate.</p>

  <p>In some cases not only are the pores filled with mineral
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id=
  "Page_15">15</a></span> matter, but the solid parts themselves
  have been replaced, and the whole mass has actually become stone,
  while still retaining its original structure. Thus silicified
  wood is often as hard and solid as agate, and under the
  microscope we see that the wood has entirely perished, and is
  represented by silica or flint, differing merely in colour from
  that which fills the cavities. In this case we may imagine the
  wood to have been acted on by water holding in solution silica,
  combined with soda or potash, in the manner of what is termed
  soluble glass. The wood, in decay, would be converted into carbon
  dioxide, and this as formed would seize on the potash or soda,
  leaving the silica in an insoluble state, to be deposited instead
  of the carbon. Thus each particle of the carbon of the wood, as
  removed by decay, would be replaced by a particle of silica, till
  the whole became stone. By similar chemical changes corals and
  shells are often represented by silica, or by pyrite, which has
  taken the place of the original calcareous matter; and still more
  remarkable changes sometimes occur, as when the siliceous
  spicules of sponges have been replaced by carbonate of lime. The
  organic matter present in the fossils greatly promotes these
  changes, by the substances produced in its decay, and thus it
  often happens that the shells, corals, etc., contained in
  limestone have been replaced by flint, while the inclosing
  limestone is unchanged. <a href="#f10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a> shows the various conditions
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id=
  "Page_16">16</a></span> which a coral may assume under these
  different modes of treatment.</p>

  <p>The substance of a fossil may be entirely removed by decay

  mere mould representing its external form, and this may
  subsequently be filled with mineral matter, so as to produce a
  natural cast of the object. This is very common in the case of
  fossil plants; and large trunks of trees may sometimes be found
  represented, as seen in <a href="#f11">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>, by stony pillars retaining
  nothing of the original wood except perhaps a portion of the bark
  in the state of coal. It sometimes happens that the substance of
  fossils has been removed, leaving mere empty cavities, sometimes
  containing stony cores representing the internal chambers of the
  fossils. Again, calcareous fossils imbedded in hard rocks are
  often removed by weathering, leaving very perfect impressions of
  their forms. For this reason the fossil remains contained in some
  hard resisting rocks can be best seen as impressed moulds on the
  weathered surfaces.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we sometimes have impressions or footprints
  representing the locomotion of fossil animals, rather than the
  fossils themselves. In this way some extinct creatures are known
  to us only by their footsteps on sand or clay, once soft, but
  now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=
  "Page_17">17</a></span> hardened into stone; and in the case of
  some of the lower animals the trails thus made are often not
  easily interpreted (<a href="#f12">Figs.&nbsp;12, 12<i>a</i></a>). It has been found that
  even sea-weeds drifted by the tide make impressions of this kind,
  which, when they occur in old rocks, are very mysterious. Even
  rain-drops are capable of being permanently impressed on rocks,
  and constitute a kind of fossils. Besides these we have many
  kinds of imitative markings which simulate fossils, as those of
  concretions or nodules, which are often very fantastic in shape,
  those of dendritic crystallisation giving moss-like forms, and
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id=
  "Page_18">18</a></span> complicated tracery produced on muddy
  shores by the little rills of water which follow the receding
  tide (<a href="#f13">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>). Such things are often mistaken by the
  ignorant for fossil remains, but are easily distinguished by a
  practised eye.</p>

  <p>The reader who has followed these, perhaps somewhat dry,

  conception of the conditions in which we find fossil remains, and
  of the evidence by which we can refer these to different periods

  <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the beginning of life on the
  earth.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/tcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "T" /><span class="smcap">he</span> day must have been when the
  first living being appeared for the first time on our planet. Was
  it plant or animal? or a generalised organism uniting in some
  mysterious way the properties and powers of two kingdoms of
  nature, now so distinct, and even contrary to each other in their
  manifestations? Did it appear suddenly, or was it slowly evolved
  from dead matter by some process in which the albuminous or
  protoplasmic matter, which we know forms the basal substance of
  living beings, was first produced and then endowed with life? Did
  the first living being appear in a mature state, or was it merely
  a germ from which the mature individual could be produced? These
  are questions which science in its present state has no means of
  answering. We do not know any process by which the ingredients of
  protoplasm can be combined so as to produce that substance
  without a previous living being. We do not know what molecular
  differences may exist between dead albumen and that which we see
  growing and moving and instinct with life; still less do we know
  how to set up or establish these differences. We do not know the
  precise nature or relation to other forces of the energy which
  actuates living organisms. In our experience the simplest
  creatures that have life spring from previous germs, themselves
  the products of previous generations of living beings. Thus we
  are in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id=
  "Page_22">22</a></span> presence of great mysteries which it
  might be impossible for us to solve, even if we were permitted to
  visit some new planet on which the dawn of life was breaking.</p>

  <p>Some things, however, we can infer as to the conditions of the
  introduction of life.</p>

  <p>First, there is every reason to believe that the earth we
  inhabit was once a glowing, incandescent mass, condensing from a
  vaporous condition, and quite unfit for the abode of living
  beings, and which, even if in some previous state its materials
  had constituted the mass of an inhabited world, must have lost
  every trace of any living germ in the fervent heat to which it
  had been subjected. There must, therefore, have been in some way
  an absolute creation or origination of life and organisation.</p>

  <p>Secondly, we may infer that in the earlier stages of the
  earth, when it was perhaps wholly or almost entirely covered with
  the waters, when it was still uniformly warmed with its own
  internal heat, when it was surrounded with a pall of dense
  vapours preventing radiation, and nursing its heat within itself,
  though in a condition entirely unsuited to the higher forms of
  life, it may have presented circumstances more favourable to the
  origination and multiplication of living beings of low
  organisation than at any subsequent time. This incubation of
  creative power in the vaporous mantle over the prim&aelig;val
  ocean was a favourite imagination of old thinkers, and is not
  obscurely hinted at in the Book of Genesis. It has been revived
  and much insisted on by evolutionists in our own time, though it
  has no certain foundation in scientific observation or
  experiment.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, from the fact that plant-life alone has the power of
  subsisting on inorganic matter, and that plants furnish all the
  nourishment of animals, we may fairly infer that the life of the
  plant preceded that of the animal. It has, indeed, been suggested
  that some of the humbler forms of life may combine in a rude and
  simple way enough of the powers of the plant <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> and the
  animal to enable them to bridge over the double gap between the
  animal and the plant, and the animal and the mineral, or that
  such creatures may in their early stages carry on vegetable
  functions, and in their later those of the animal. It is
  theoretically possible that life may have begun with such
  creatures, which some of the results of microscopical research
  would lead us to believe still exist. It is, however, on the
  whole more probable that simple plants first existed, and
  furnished pabulum to animals of low grade introduced almost
  contemporaneously.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, all our knowledge of the succession of life leads us
  to believe that it was not the higher plants and animals that
  first sprang into existence from the teeming earth, but creatures
  of low and humble organisation, suited to the then immature and
  unfinished condition of the planet. It is also in accordance with
  the amazing fecundity of the seas in all geological periods in
  these lower forms of life, to suppose that the earliest living
  things originated in the waters, and that the plants and animals
  of the land are of later date.</p>

  <p>Do we know anything from actual observation of this earliest
  population of the world? Such knowledge we can hope to acquire
  only by studying the oldest formations known to us; and these, it
  must be confessed, exist in a state so highly crystalline, and so
  much affected by internal heat, by mechanical pressure, and by
  movement, as to render it little likely that organic remains
  should be preserved in them in a state fit for recognition.</p>

  <p>In many parts of the world, and notably in Canada and
  Scandinavia, as well as in Wales, Scotland, and Bavaria, the
  older Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks, the lowest containing plants in
  great abundance, rest on still older crystalline beds, which have
  become hard and crystalline in pre-Pal&aelig;ozoic times, and
  have contributed sand and pebbles to the succeeding very ancient
  deposits. These old rocks&mdash;the Eozoic series of our
  table&mdash;may be grouped in two great systems, the Laurentian
  and Huronian <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id=
  "Page_24">24</a></span> (<a href="#f14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). The former may be
  conveniently divided into three members: First, the Bojian, or
  Ottawa gneiss, consisting of stratified granite rocks, usually of
  a red colour, and of very great thickness. This contains, so far
  as known, no limestone, and has afforded as yet no trace of
  fossils. Secondly, the Middle Laurentian, the greater part of
  which consists of gneiss, but containing important beds of other
  rocks, as quartzite, iron ore, and limestone. It is in this
  series that we have the first evidence of life, and it is here
  also that we find the greatest abundance of carbon, in the form
  of graphite or plumbago, and also large quantities of calcium
  phosphate, or bone earth. Thirdly, the Upper Laurentian or Norian
  series. This consists in great part of Labadorite, or lime
  feldspar, but has also beds of ordinary gneiss, limestone, and
  iron ore.</p>

  Laurentian. <i>c</i>, Upper Laurentian. <i>d</i>, Huronian.
  <i>e</i>, Cambrian and Silurian.</p>

  <p>The latter, the Huronian, is much less crystalline, and is
  divisible into two series&mdash;the Lower Huronian, which
  includes many beds of volcanic origin, and the Upper Huronian,
  which has afforded some obscure fossils. The Huronian was first
  recognised by Sir W. E. Logan in Canada, but corresponding rocks
  exist in Europe. The Pebidian series of Hicks in Wales is
  probably of this age.</p>

  <p>It is likely that much of the present appearance and condition
  of the most ancient rocks may be attributed to metamorphism, that
  is, to the slow baking under the influence of heat, heated water,
  and pressure, to which they have been subjected in the lower
  parts of the earth&rsquo;s crust, when buried deeply under newer
  deposits. It is also true, however, as <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> Dr. Sterry
  Hunt has pointed out in detail, that they present mineral
  characters which show a mode of deposition different from that
  which has prevailed subsequently, and probably indicating great
  ejections of heated mineral matter into the primitive ocean, and
  comparatively little of that deposit therein of mere sand and
  clay which has prevailed in subsequent geological periods. In
  short, these rocks have an unmistakably primitive aspect,
  distinguishing them from those of later times, and conveying the
  impression that they approach at least to the records of that
  time when a heated ocean first rested on the thin and recently
  solidified crust of our planet. If this is really the case, then
  our Lower Laurentian&mdash;hard, compact, destitute of limestone,
  and composed of material which may be little else than the
  <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of products of internal heat merely spread
  out into bedded forms by water&mdash;may represent a time when no
  living thing as yet tenanted the waters; and the dawn of life may
  have appeared in that period when the Middle Laurentian beds were
  laid down. Here at least we find two kinds of evidence pointing
  to the existence of certain forms of life in the waters.</p>

  <p>The first depends on the mineral character of the beds
  themselves. This formation holds several very thick beds of
  limestone. Now although this kind of rock may, under certain
  circumstances, be deposited directly from solution in water, it
  is not ordinarily so deposited, but more usually through the
  agency of living beings inhabiting the waters, and forming their
  skeletons or hard parts of limestone derived from the water,
  usually through the medium of humble forms of plant life. In this
  way are formed reefs of coral and beds of shells and of chalky
  ooze, all composed of material once constituting the skeletons of
  animals. The study of limestones of all geological ages shows
  that this has been the usual mode of their formation. If the
  Laurentian limestones had a similar origin, the seas of that
  period must have swarmed with animals having calcareous
  coverings; and the study of more modern <span class=

  which have become highly crystalline shows that it is quite
  possible that the forms and structures of these organisms may
  have been obliterated.</p>

  <p>Again, the Middle Laurentian abounds in carbon or coaly
  matter. True, this is in the form of graphite or plumbago, but
  this condition may be a result of metamorphism; and we know that
  the carbon of coal-beds and bituminous shales of much more modern
  times has been altered into graphite. Further, the graphite
  occurs in the way in which we should expect it to occur if of
  organic origin. It is found disseminated in the limestone, just
  as bituminous matter is found in unaltered rocks of this kind. It
  is found interlaminated with gneiss, as carbonaceous and
  bituminous matters are found in the shales of the ordinary
  fossiliferous rocks, where these substances are known to be of
  organic origin. The graphite also occurs in a very pure form in
  irregular veins, just as in some bituminous formations the rock
  oil, oozing into fissures, has been hardened into asphalt or
  coaly matter.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
  "FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
  "fnanchor">3</a></p>

  <p>To these facts may be added the presence of thick beds and
  veins of iron ore and of apatite or calcium phosphate (bone
  earth). Both of these substances occur in a disseminated state in
  nearly all rocks, but they are concentrated into definite
  deposits by the action of life. Iron is usually dissolved out and
  redeposited by acids produced in the decay of vegetable matter,
  as we see in the clay ironstones of the coal formation and in
  bog-iron ores. Calcic phosphate is taken up by many animals, and
  forms their shells or skeletons, and on their death is deposited
  in beds on the sea-bottom, sometimes to a very considerable
  extent.</p>

  <p>The concurrence of all these phenomena in the Middle
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
  "Page_27">27</a></span> Laurentian may be held to afford a strong
  presumption that, could we discover these rocks in an unaltered
  state, we should find the limestones filled with marine fossils
  and the graphite showing the forms or structure of plants. The
  only startling feature in this conclusion is, that if we admit
  it, we must also admit that life was developed in the Laurentian
  time in an exuberance not surpassed, if equalled, in any
  subsequent period. Still, there is nothing incredible in this,
  for if the forms of life were few and low, their increase may
  have been rapid, because unchecked; and they no doubt found in
  the ancient seas a surplusage of material on which to feed and
  with which to construct their skeletons. Dr. Hunt has estimated
  that the amount of carbon now sealed up as coaly matter would, if
  diffused in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, afford 600 times
  the quantity of that gas at present floating in the air. A still
  more vast amount is sealed up in the limestone of the several
  geological formations. The same chemist has shown that the
  quantity of lime held in solution in the ocean must have been
  much greater in Laurentian times than at present. These facts at
  least allow us to suppose that in the Eozoic times there were
  great supplies of carbon and of lime available to such creatures
  of low organisation as were capable of profiting by them; and we
  have no reason to doubt that there may have been plants and
  animals so constituted as to flourish in conditions of this kind,
  in which perhaps scarcely any modern species could exist.</p>

  <p>These probabilities have caused geologists anxiously to search
  for any traces of fossil organic remains in the old Laurentian
  rocks; and they have been rewarded by the discovery of one
  species, <i>Eozoon Canadense</i>, still often referred to as only
  a problematical fossil; but this arises to a large extent from
  the prevalent want of knowledge sufficient to appreciate the
  evidence for its organic character. This being once admitted, we
  have in the existence of <i>Eozoon</i> alone a sufficient cause
  for the accumulation of much of the Laurentian
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
  limestone, though there is reason to believe that it was not the
  only inhabitant of those ancient seas.</p>

  <p>The best specimens of <i>Eozoon</i> occur as rounded, flattened, or
  more or less irregular lumps or masses in certain layers of the
  Laurentian limestone. When weathered on the surface of the rock,
  these lumps show a regular concentric lamination, caused by thin
  fibres of limestone, alternating with other mineral substances,
  filling up the spaces between them. When these intervening layers
  are composed of such minerals as Serpentine, Loganite, Pyroxene,
  or Dolomite, which are more <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> resisting than the
  limestone, they project when weathered, or when the limestone is
  etched by an acid, so as to show the lamination very distinctly.
  At the lower surface of the masses the layers are seen to be
  thicker than they are above, and in perfect specimens they are
  seen toward the surface to break up into small rounded vesicles
  of calcite, like little bubbles, which constitute the so-called
  acervuline condition of <i>Eozoon</i> (<a href="#f15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>, No. 2). Slices of the
  fossil etched with an acid show these appearances very perfectly,
  and can even be printed from, so as to present perfect
  nature-prints of the structure (<a href="#f16">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>).</p>

  </div>

  <p>On etching a small fragment or slice with very dilute acid,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id=
  "Page_30">30</a></span> so as to dissolve away the calcite
  slowly, if the specimen be well preserved, we find that the
  calcite layers have a very curious structure. This is indicated
  by the appearance of little white or transparent threads of
  Serpentine, Dolomite, or Pyroxene, which ramify throughout the
  substance of the limestone layers, and are left intact when they
  have been dissolved. These little processes must originally have
  been pores in the limestone layers, which have been filled with
  the substance which constitutes the alternate lamin&aelig;. In
  addition to this, if we use a somewhat high microscopic power,
  and especially if we study the structures as seen in thin
  transparent slices, we can perceive a still finer tubulation
  along the sides of the calcite layers, represented by extremely
  minute parallel rods of mineral matter (<a href="#f17">Figs.&nbsp;17, 18</a>).</p>

  <p>Now if we regard these structures as those of an infiltrated
  fossil, as described in last chapter, their interpretation will
  not be difficult. The original organism was composed of
  calcareous matter in thin concentric lamin&aelig;, connected with
  each other by pillars and plates of similar material. Between
  these lamin&aelig; was lodged the soft, jelly-like substance of a
  marine animal, growing by the addition of successive layers, each
  protected by a thin calcareous crust. The layers were originally
  traversed by very numerous parallel tubuli, permitting the soft
  protoplasm to penetrate them; and when, in the progress of
  growth, it was necessary to strengthen these layers, they were
  thickened by a supplemental deposit traversed by larger and
  ramifying canals. When the animal was dead, and its soft parts
  removed by decay, the chambers between the lamin&aelig;, as well
  as the minute canals and tubuli, became infiltrated with mineral
  matter, in the manner described in the last chapter, and when so
  preserved became absolutely imperishable under any circumstances
  short of absolute fusion.</p>

  <p>This interpretation leads to the conclusion, at which I
  arrived from the study of the first well-preserved specimen ever
  submitted to microscopic examination, that the animal which
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">31<br />
  32</a></span> produced the calcareous skeleton of <i>Eozoon</i> was a
  member of that lowest grade of Protozoa known as Foraminifera;
  and which, after living through the whole of geological time,
  still abound in the sea. The main differences are, that <i>Eozoon</i>
  presents a somewhat generalised structure, intermediate between
  two modern types, and that it attained to a gigantic size
  compared with most of these organisms in later periods. How near
  it approaches in structure to some modern forms may be seen by
  comparison of the recent species represented in <a href="#f19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>, in
  which the parts corresponding to the chambers, lamin&aelig;,
  tubuli, and canals of <i>Eozoon</i> can be readily distinguished.</p>

  <p>The modern animals of this group are wholly composed of soft
  gelatinous protoplasm or sarcode, the outer layer of which is
  usually somewhat denser than the inner portion; but both are
  structureless, except that the inner layer may present a more
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id=
  "Page_33">33</a></span> or less distinct granular appearance.
  Many of them show a distinct spot or cell, called the nucleus,
  and some have minute transparent vesicles, which contract and
  expand alternately, and appear to be of the nature of circulatory
  or excretory organs. They have no proper alimentary canal, but
  receive their food into the general mass and digest it in
  temporary cavities. Their means of locomotion and prehension are
  soft thread-like or finger-like processes, extended at will from
  the surface of any part of the body, and known as false feet
  (pseudopodia). From these processes the whole group has obtained
  the name of Rhizopods, or rootfooted animals. They may be
  regarded as constituting the simplest and humblest form of animal
  life certainly known to us.</p>

  <p>The very numerous species of these creatures existing in the
  waters of the modern world may be arranged under three principal
  groups. The first and highest includes those which have lobate or
  finger-like pseudopods, and a well-developed nucleus and
  pulsating vesicle (<a href="#f20">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>, <i>a</i>). They are mostly
  inhabitants of fresh water, and destitute of a hard crust or
  shell. A second group, including many inhabitants of the sea as
  well as of fresh waters, has thread-like radiating
  pseudopodia<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> (<a href="#f20">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>&nbsp;<i>b</i>). Some
  of these form beautiful silicious skeletons. A third group,
  essentially marine, consists of those with reticulated
  pseudopodia, and usually destitute of distinct nucleus and
  pulsating vesicle (<a href="#f21">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>). They produce beautiful
  calcareous skeletons, often very complex, or sometimes are
  content to cover themselves with a crust of agglutinated grains
  of sand. It is to this last group that <i>Eozoon</i> belongs, and to the
  highest division of it&mdash;that which has the shell perforated
  with minute pores, often of two kinds. It is curious that just as
  we have the chambers and pores of <i>Eozoon</i> filled with serpentine,
  so in all geological formations and in the modern seas it is not
  uncommon to find Foraminifera having their cavities <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>filled with
  glauconite and other hydrous silicates allied to serpentine.</p>

  <p>If we attempt to trace the Rhizopods onward from the Middle

  has, however, been found in rocks apparently of Huronian age; but
  this is the last known appearance of <i>Eozoon</i>, properly so-called.
  In the Cambrian or Siluro-Cambrian, however, we meet with many
  gigantic Protozoa, more especially those known as
  <i>Stromatopora</i>, <i>Arch&aelig;ocyathus</i>,
  <i>Receptaculites</i>, and <i>Cryptozoon</i>.</p>

  <p>The typical Stromatopor&aelig;, or Layer-corals, consist, like
  <i>Eozoon</i>, of concentric layers, connected by numerous pillars,
  which are often, though not always, more definite and regular
  than in the Laurentian fossil. The lamin&aelig; are perforated,
  but more coarsely than in <i>Eozoon</i>, and they are often thickened
  with supplemental deposit which, in some of the forms, presents
  canals radiating from vertical tubes or bundles of tubes
  penetrating the mass (<a href="#f22">Figs.&nbsp;22, 23</a>). The mode of growth of
  <i>Stromatopora</i> must have closely resembled that of <i>Eozoon</i>, and the
  forms produced are so similar that it is often quite impossible
  to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
  "Page_36">36</a></span> distinguish them by the naked eye. Like
  <i>Eozoon</i>, they form the substance of important limestones, and
  single masses are sometimes found as much as three feet in
  diameter. The Stromatopor&aelig; extend from the Upper Cambrian
  to the Devonian inclusive. In the Carboniferous they are
  continued by smaller and more regular organisms of the genus
  <i>Loftusia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id=
  "FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
  and this genus seems to extend without marked change up to the
  Eocene Tertiary. Recent students of the Stromatopor&aelig; seem
  disposed to promote them from the province of Protozoa to that of
  the Hydroids.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
  "FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
  The reasons for this seem cogent in the case of some of the
  forms, but in my judgment fail in others, more especially in the
  older forms. It may ultimately be found that the group as now
  held includes very different types of structure. In modern times
  I know of no nearer representative than the animal whose skeleton
  often adheres in red encrusting patches to our specimens of
  corals, and which is known as <i>Polytrema</i>. In general
  structure it is not very far from being a very degenerate kind of
  <i>Stromatopora</i>.</p>

  <p>It is curious that in the line of succession above stated, the
  beautiful tubulated cell-wall of <i>Eozoon</i> disappears; and this
  structure seems, after the Laurentian, to be for ever divorced
  from the great laminated Protozoans. It reappears in the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id=
  "Page_37">37</a></span>Carboniferous, in certain smaller
  organisms of the type of the <i>Nummulites</i>, or Money-stone
  Foraminifers, and is continued in this group of smaller and free
  animals down to the present time. In the Cretaceous and early
  Tertiary periods, the Foraminifera of different types have been
  nearly as great rock-builders as they were in the Laurentian.
  Some of these later rock-builders, however, have belonged to the
  lower or imperforate group; others to the higher or Rotaline and
  Nummuline groups; and, as a whole, they have been individually
  small, making up in numbers what they lacked in size. Probably
  the conditions for enabling animals of this type rapidly, and on
  a large scale, to collect calcareous matter, were more favourable
  in the Laurentian than they have ever been since.</p>

  <p>In the Siluro-Cambrian age two other forms of gigantic
  Foraminiferal Protozoans were introduced, widely different from
  <i>Eozoon</i>, and destined apparently not to survive the period
  in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id=
  "Page_38">38</a></span> which they appeared. These were
  <i>Arch&aelig;ocyathus</i>, the ancient Cup-corals, and Receptaculites,
  which may perhaps be called the Sack-corals. Both are quite
  remote from <i>Eozoon</i> in structure, wanting its complexity in the
  matter of minute tubules, and having greater regularity and
  complication on the large scale. <i>Arch&aelig;ocyathus</i> had the form
  of a hollow inverted cone with double perforated walls, connected
  by radiating irregular plates, also perforated (<a href="#f24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>). It
  has been regarded as a sponge, and some species are certainly
  accompanied with spicules; but these I have ascertained to be
  merely accidental, and will be referred to in the next chapter.
  The true structure of Arch&aelig;ocyathus consists of radiating
  calcareous plates enclosing chambers connected by pores.
  <i>Arch&aelig;ocyathus</i> came in with the Later Cambrian, and seems to
  have died out in the Siluro-Cambrian. The only more modern things
  which at all resemble it are the Foraminifera called
  <i>Dactylopora</i>, which belong to the Tertiary period.</p>

  <p>We thus have presented to us the remarkable fact that in the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic age we have no precise representative of <i>Eozoon</i>,
  but instead three divergent types, differing from it and from
  each other, all apparently specialised to particular uses, all
  temporary in their duration; while in later times nature seems to
  have returned nearer to the type of <i>Eozoon</i>, though on a smaller
  scale, and separating some characters conjoined in it. Some
  portion of this curious result may be due to our ignorance; and
  it would be interesting to know, what we may know
  some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=

  represented in the long interval between the Huronian and the
  Upper Cambrian, when perhaps there may have been forms that would
  at least enable us to connect <i>Eozoon</i> and <i>Stromatopora</i>.</p>

  <p>Another link in the chain of being remains to be noticed here.
  In the Laurentian limestones we meet with numerous minute
  spherical bodies and groups of spheres with calcareous tubulated
  tests.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> These may either be small
  Foraminifer&aelig;, distinct from <i>Eozoon</i>, or may be germs or
  detached cells from its surface. Similar bodies are found in the
  lower part of the Siluro-Cambrian, in the Quebec group at Point
  Levis; and there they are filled with a species of glauconite
  constituting a sort of greensand rock. Still higher, in the
  Carboniferous, there are very numerous species of Foraminifera,
  presenting forms very similar to those in the modern seas, so
  that in the smaller shells of this group we seem to have evidence
  of a continuous series all the way from the Laurentian to the
  present time. The greater laminated forms co-exist with these up
  to the Eocene Tertiary. Throughout the whole of geological
  time&mdash;from the formation of the Laurentian limestones to
  that of the chalky ooze accumulating in the modern
  ocean&mdash;these humble creatures have been among the chief
  instruments in seizing on the calcareous matter of the waters and
  depositing it in the form of limestone.</p>

  <p>I have said nothing of the development of higher forms of
  animal life from <i>Eozoon</i>, simply because I know nothing of it. We
  shall see in the next chapter that these are introduced seemingly
  in an independent manner. We may be content to trace
  foraminiferal life along its own line of development, waxing and
  waning, but ever confined within the same general boundaries,
  from the Laurentian to the present time. It is likely that if, in
  any of the ages constituting this vast lapse of time, a dredge
  had been dropped into the depths of ocean, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>it would
  have brought up Foraminifera not essentially different in form
  and structure. If any one asks to what extent the successive
  species constituting this almost endless chain may be descendants
  one of the other, we have no absolutely certain information to
  give. On the one hand, it is not inconceivable that such forms as
  <i>Stromatopora</i> or <i>Nummulina</i> may have descended from <i>Eozoon</i>. On the
  other hand, it is equally conceivable that the same power which
  produced <i>Eozoon</i> at first, whether from dead matter or from some
  unknown lower form of life, may have repeated the process in
  later times with modifications. In any case it is probable that
  the Foraminifera have experienced alternations of expansion and
  shrinkage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id=
  "Page_42">42</a></span> of elevation and decadence, in the lapse
  of geological time. There were times in which many new forms
  swarmed into existence, and times in which old forms were
  becoming extinct without being replaced by others. In so far as
  the areas of the continents and the adjacent waters are
  concerned, those periods when the land was subsiding under the
  ocean must have been their times of prosperity, those in which
  the crust of the earth shrunk and raised up large areas of land
  must have been their times of decay. Still this lowest form of
  animal life has never perished, but has always found abundant
  place for itself, however pressed by physical change and by the
  introduction of higher beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name=

  <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the age of invertebrates of the
  sea.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/icap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "I" /><span class="smcap">f</span> the middle portion of the
  Laurentian age was really a time of exuberant and abounding life,
  either this met with strange reverses in succeeding periods, or
  the conditions of preservation have been such as to prevent us
  from tracing its onward history. Certain it is, that according to
  present appearances we have a new beginning in the Cambrian,
  which introduces the great Pal&aelig;ozoic age, and few links of
  connection are known between this and the previous Eozoic.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the Pal&aelig;ozoic we have reason to
  believe that our continents were slowly subsiding under the sea,
  after a period of general continental elevation which was
  consequent on the crumbling of the earth&rsquo;s crust at the
  close of the Eozoic; and on the new sea-bottoms formed by this
  subsidence came in, slowly at first, but in ever-increasing
  swarms, the abundant and varied life of the early
  Pal&aelig;ozoic.</p>

  <p>In the oldest portion of the Cambrian series in Wales, Hicks
  has catalogued species of no less than seventeen genera,
  embracing Crustaceans, the representatives of our crabs and
  lobsters, bivalve and univalve shell-fishes of different types,
  worms, sea-stars, zoophytes, and sponges. If we could have walked
  on the shores of the old Cambrian sea, or cast our dredge or
  trawl into its depths, we should have found representatives of
  most of the humbler forms of sea life still extant,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> though of
  specific forms strange to us. Perhaps the nearest approach to
  such experience which we can make is to examine the group of
  Cambrian animals delineated in <a href="#f28">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>, and to notice, under
  the guidance of the geologist above named, the sections seen at
  St. David&rsquo;s, in South Wales.</p>

  <p>Here we find a nucleus of ancient rocks supposed to be
  Laurentian, though in mineral character more nearly akin to the
  Huronian, but which have hitherto afforded no trace of fossils.
  Resting unconformably on these is a series of partially altered
  rocks, regarded as Lower Cambrian, and also destitute of organic
  remains. These have a thickness of almost 1,000 feet, and they
  are succeeded by 3,000 feet more of similar rocks, still classed
  as Lower Cambrian, but which have afforded fossils. The lowest
  bed which contains indications of life is a red shale, perhaps a
  deep-sea bed, and possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47"
  id="Page_47">47</a></span> itself partly of organic origin, by
  that strange process of decomposition or dissolution of
  foraminiferal ooze and volcanic fragments, going on in the depths
  of the modern ocean, and described by Dr. Wyville Thomson as
  occurring over large areas in the South Pacific. The species are
  two <i>Lingulell&aelig;</i>, a <i>Discina</i> and a
  <i>Leperditia</i>. Supposing these to be all, it is remarkable
  that we have no Protozoa or Corals or Echinoderms, and that the
  types of Brachiopods and Crustaceans are of comparatively modern
  affinities. Passing upward through another 1,000 feet of barren
  sandstone, we reach a zone in which no less than five genera of
  Trilobites are found, along with Pteropods and a sponge. Thus it
  is that life comes in at the base of the Cambrian in Wales, and
  it may be regarded as a fair specimen of the facts as they appear
  in the earlier fossiliferous beds succeeding the Laurentian.
  Taking the first of these groups of fossils, we may recognise in
  the <i>Leperditia</i> a two-valved Crustacean closely allied to forms
  still living in the seas and fresh waters. The Lingulell&aelig;,
  whether we regard them as molluscoids, or, with Professor Morse,
  as singularly specialised worms, represent a peculiar and
  distinct type, handed down, through all the vicissitudes of the
  geological ages, to the present day. The Pteropods and the sponge
  are very similar to forms now living. The Trilobites are an
  extinct group, but closely allied to some modern Crustaceans. Had
  the primordial life begun with species altogether inscrutable and
  unexampled in succeeding ages, this would no doubt have been
  mysterious; but next to this is the mystery of the oldest forms
  of life being also among the newest. Whatever the origin of these
  creatures, they represent families which have endured till now in
  the struggle for existence without either elevation or
  degradation. Yet, though thus vast in their duration, they seem
  to have swarmed in together and in great numbers, in the
  Cambrian, without any previous preparation. From the Cambrian
  onward, throughout the whole Pal&aelig;ozoic, there is no decided
  break in the continuity of marine life; and<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> already in
  the Silurian period the sea was tenanted with all the forms of
  invertebrate life it yet presents, and these in a teeming
  abundance not surpassed in any succeeding age. Let us now, in
  accordance with our plan, select some of these ancient
  inhabitants of the waters and trace their subsequent history.</p>

  <p>Remains of sea-weeds are undoubtedly present in the Cambrian
  rocks. One of the lowest beds in Sweden has been named from their
  abundance the Fucoidal Sandstone; and wherever fossiliferous
  Cambrian rocks occur, some traces, more or less obscure, of these
  plants may be found. Nearly all that we can say of them, however,
  is, that, in so far as their remains give any information, they
  are very like the plants of the same group that now abound in our
  seas. In the fucoidal sandstone of Sweden certain striated or
  ribbed bodies have been found, which have even been regarded as
  land plants;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> but they seem rather to be
  trails or marks left by sea-weeds dragged by currents over a
  muddy bottom. The plants of the sea thus precede those of the
  land, and they begin on the same level as to structure that they
  have since maintained. I agree with Nathorst, however, in holding
  that the Bilobites and many other forms believed by some to be
  sea-weeds, are really trails and tracks of animals.<a name=
  "FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
  class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

  <p>The Foraminifera of the Pal&aelig;ozoic we have noticed in the
  last chapter; but we now find a new type of Protozoan&mdash;that
  of the Sponge. Sponges as they exist at present may be defined to
  be composite animals, made up of a great number of one-celled or
  gelatinous zoids, provided with vibrating threads or cilia, and
  so arranged that currents of water are driven through passages or
  canals in the mass, by the action of the cilia, bringing food and
  aerated water for respiration. To support these soft sarcodic
  sponge-masses, they secrete fibres of horny matter and needles
  (spicul&aelig;) of flint or of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>limestone, forming
  complicated fibrous and spicular skeletons, often of great
  beauty. They abound in all seas, and some species are found in
  fresh waters.</p>

  <p>With the exception of a very few species destitute of
  skeleton, and which we cannot expect to find in a fossil state,
  the sponges may be roughly divided into three groups: 1, those
  with corneous or horny skeleton, like our common washing sponges;
  2, those with skeletons composed of silicious needles of various
  forms and arrangement; 3, those with calcareous spicules. Of
  these, the second or silicious group has precedence in point of
  time, beginning in the Early Cambrian, and continuing to the
  present. Two of its subdivisions are especially interesting in
  their range. The first is that of the Lattice-sponges
  (<i>Hexactinellid&aelig;</i>), in which the spicules have six
  rays placed at right angles, and are attached to each other by
  their points, so as to form a very regular network
  (<a href="#f29">Fig.&nbsp;29</a>). The second is that of the Stone-sponges
  (<i>Lithistid&aelig;</i>), in which<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span> the spicules are four-rayed
  or irregular, and are united by the branching root-like ends of
  the rays. The most beautiful of all sponges, the Venus
  Flower-basket (<i>Euplectella</i>), is a modern Hexactinellid,
  and the wonderful weaving of its spicules is as marvellous a
  triumph of constructive skill as its general form is graceful.
  The Lithistids are less beautiful, but are the densest and most
  compact of sponges, and are represented by several species in the
  modern seas. Both of these types go back to the Early Cambrian,
  and have continued side by side to the present day, as
  representatives of two distinct geometrical methods for the
  construction of a spicular skeleton.</p>

  <p>Many years ago the keen eye of the late lamented Salter
  detected in a stain on the surface of a slab of Cambrian slate
  the remains of a sponge; and minute examination showed that its
  spicules crossed each other, and formed lattice-work on the
  hexactinellid plan. Salter boldly named it <i>Protospongia</i> (the
  first sponge), and it is still the earliest that we know (Fig.
  30). Thus the type whose skeleton is the most perfect in a
  mechanical point of view takes the lead. It is continued in the
  Silurian in many curious forms, of which the stalkless sponges
  (<i>Astylospongia</i>) are the most common (<a href="#f31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>). It
  perhaps attains its maximum in the Cretaceous, from which the
  beautiful example in <a href="#f29">Fig.&nbsp;29</a> is taken, and it still
  flourishes, giving us the most beautiful of all recent forms.
  Before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id=
  "Page_51">51</a></span> close of the Cambrian there were other
  sponges of the Lithistid type. <a href="#f32">Fig.&nbsp;32</a> represents a group of
  spicules from the Calciferous (Lowest Silurian or Upper Cambrian)
  of Mingan,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id=
  "FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class=
  "fnanchor">10</a> and which probably belong to a large Lithistid
  sponge of that early time. The Lithistids have been recognised in
  the Upper Silurian and Carboniferous, and continuing upward to
  the Cretaceous, there become vastly numerous, while their
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id=
  "Page_52">52</a></span>modern representatives are by no means
  few. The silicious sponges with simple spicules appear to have
  existed as far back as the Siluro-Cambrian, and there is believed
  to be almost as early evidence of horny or corneous sponges. The
  calcareous sponges have been recognised as far back as the
  Silurian.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
  "FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
  "fnanchor">11</a> Thus from the close of the Pal&aelig;ozoic all
  the types of sponges seem to have existed side by side; and in
  the Cretaceous period, when such large areas of our continents
  were deeply submerged, they attained a wonderful development,
  perhaps not equalled in any other era of the earth&rsquo;s
  history.</p>

  <p>Sponges may be regarded as the highest or most complex of the
  Protozoa or the lowest of the Coelenterates. We have no links
  wherewith to connect them with the lower Protozoa of the Eozoic
  period; and through their long history, though very numerous in
  genera and species, they show no closer relationship with the
  Foraminifera below, and the Corals above, than do their
  successors in the modern seas. They thus stand very <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>much apart;
  and modern studies of their development and minute structures do
  not seem to remove them from this isolation. Though we are
  treating here of inhabitants of the sea, it may be proper to
  mention that Geinitz has described two species from the Permian
  which he believed to be early precursors of the Spongill&aelig;,
  or fresh-water sponges; but more recently he seems to regard them
  as probably Alg&aelig;. Young has, however, recently found true
  spicules of <i>Spongilla</i> in the Purbeck beds.<a name=

  <p>A stage higher than the sponges are those little polyp-like
  animals with sac-like bodies and radiating arms or tentacles,
  which form minute horny or calcareous cells, and bud out into
  branching communities, looking to untrained eyes like delicate
  sea-weeds&mdash;the sea-firs and sea-mosses of our coasts
  (<a href="#f36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>). These belong to a very old group, for in the
  oldest Cambrian we have a form referred to this type
  (<a href="#f33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>), and in the Upper Cambrian another still more
  decided example (<a href="#f34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>).<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=

  increased in variety and extended itself with amazing rapidity,
  for in the Siluro-Cambrian age we find it already as
  characteristic as in our modern seas, and so abundant that vast
  thicknesses of shale are filled and blackened with the
  <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of forms allied to the sea-firs, and masses
  of limestone largely made up of the <span class=

  calcareous forms of the sea-mosses. As examples of the former we
  may take the <i>Graptolites</i>, so named from their resemblance
  to lines of writing, and of which several forms are represented
  in <a href="#f37">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>. The little teeth on the sides of these were
  cells, inhabited probably by polyps, like those represented in
  the modern <i>Sertularia</i> in <a href="#f36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>. Some of them were
  probably attached to the bottom. In others the branches radiated
  from a central film which may have been a hollow vesicle or
  float, enabling them to live at the surface of the water
  (<a href="#f38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>). These Graptolites are specially characteristic of
  the Upper Cambrian and Lower Silurian. The netted ones
  (<i>Dictyonema</i>), as may be seen from <a href="#f34">Figs.&nbsp;34 and 35</a>, came in
  before the close of the Cambrian, and continue unchanged to the
  Silurian, where they disappear. The branching forms, seen in
  <a href="#f37">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>, have scarcely so great a range. They thus form most
  certain marks of the period to which they belong,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> and being
  oceanic and probably floaters, they diffused themselves so
  rapidly that they appear to indicate the same geological time in
  countries so widely separated as Europe, North America, and
  Australia. It is curious, too, that while the Graptolites thus
  mark a definite geological time, and seem to disappear abruptly
  and without apparent cause, they are the first link in the long
  chain of the Hydroids, which, though under different family
  forms, continue to this day, apparently neither better nor worse
  than their perished Pal&aelig;ozoic relatives. There is a group
  of little Stony Corals (<i>Monticuliporid&aelig;</i>), which were
  possibly also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id=
  "Page_56">56</a></span> the cells of Hydroids, that have a
  similar history. They are the only known Corals that date so far
  back as the Upper Cambrian; and they continue under very similar
  forms all through the Pal&aelig;ozic, and are represented by the
  millepore corals of the present day. <a href="#f40">Fig.&nbsp;40</a> represents a
  form found at the base of the Siluro-Cambrian, and <a href="#f41">Fig.&nbsp;41</a>

  of the Hydroids, and which form plant-like aggregates. But the
  animals themselves are so different in structure that they are
  considered to be nearer allies of the bivalve shell-fishes than
  of the Corals. They are, in short, so different, that the most
  ardent evolutionist would scarcely hold a community of origin
  between them and such creatures as the Graptolites and
  Millepores, though an ordinary observer might readily confound
  the one with the other. These animals appear at the beginning of
  the Siluro-Cambrian, and such forms as that represented

  now living, are large constituents of some of the limestones of
  that period. Other forms, like that represented in
  <a href="#f39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a><i>a</i>, are very characteristic of the
  Carboniferous. These animals, individually small, though
  complicated in structure and branching into communities, scarcely
  ever of any great magnitude, humble creatures which have never
  played any great part in the world, have, nevertheless, been so
  persistent that, though specific and generic forms have been
  changed, the group may be said to be in the modern seas exactly
  what it was in those of the early Pal&aelig;ozoic, nor can it be
  affirmed to have originated in anything different, or to have
  produced anything.</p>

  <p>The true Stony Corals (<i>Anthozoa</i>) are as yet unknown in
  the Cambrian. They entered on the stage in immense abundance in
  the Siluro-Cambrian, where considerable limestones are largely
  composed of their remains, mixed, however, and sometimes
  overpowered with those of Bryozoa and Hydroids. An ordinary
  coral, such as those of which coral reefs are built&mdash;the red
  coral, used for ornament is not quite similar&mdash;is the
  skeleton of an animal constructed on the plan of a sea anemone;
  with a central stomach surrounded by radiating chambers, and
  having above a crown of tentacles. The stony coral surrounds and
  protects the soft body of the animal, and may either be a single
  cell, for one animal, or an aggregation of<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> such
  cells, constituting a rounded or branching mass. The modern star
  coral, represented in <a href="#f42">Fig.&nbsp;42</a>, is an instance of the latter
  condition. It shows nineteen or twenty animals, each with a
  central mouth and fringe of short tentacles, aggregated together,
  and two of them showing the spontaneous division by which the
  number of animals in the mass is progressively increased. The
  living coral shows only the soft animals and the animal matter
  connecting them; but if dead there would be a white stony mass
  with a star-like cell or depression corresponding to each
  animal.</p>

  <p>In their general plan, the oldest Corals were precisely of
  this character, but they presented some differences in detail,
  which have caused them to be divided into two groups, which are
  eminently characteristic of the Pal&aelig;ozoic age&mdash;the
  tabulate or floored corals, and the rugose or wrinkled corals. In
  the former (<a href="#f43">Fig.&nbsp;43</a>) the cells are usually small and
  thin-walled, often hexagonal, like a honeycomb, and are floored
  across at intervals with tabul&aelig; or horizontal plates. A few
  modern corals present a similar arrangement,<a name=
  "FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> but this kind of
  structure was far more prevalent in the Pal&aelig;ozoic. In the
  second type the animals are usually larger and often solitary,
  the cell has strongly marked radiating plates, while the
  horizontal floors are absent or subordinate, and there is usually
  a thick external rind or outer coat (<a href="#f44">Figs.&nbsp;44, 45</a>). In general
  plan, these <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
  "Page_59">59</a></span>rugose corals closely resemble those of
  our modern reefs; but they differ in their details of structure,
  and only a very few modern forms from the deep sea are regarded
  as actual modern representatives.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id=
  "FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class=
  "fnanchor">15</a> One curious point of difference is that their
  radiating lamin&aelig; begin with four, and increase by multiples
  of that number, while in modern corals the numbers are six and
  multiples of six; a change of mathematical relation not easily
  accounted for, and which assimilates them to Hydroids on the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
  "Page_60">60</a></span>one hand, and to a higher group, the
  Alcyonids, on the other, both of which prefer four and eight to
  six, or have had these numbers chosen for them. In the Mesozoic
  period the tabulate and rugose corals were replaced by others,
  the porous and solid corals of the modern seas; but, in so far as
  we know, the animals producing these, though differing in some
  details, were neither more nor less elevated than their
  predecessors, and they took up precisely the same r&ocirc;le as
  reef-builders in the sea, though with probably more tendency to
  the accumulation of great masses of coral limestone in particular
  spots.</p>

  <p>The most curious history in this group is that of the
  feather-stars. In the Early Cambrian they are represented by a
  few species known to us only in fragments, and these belong to a
  humble group (Cystideans) resembling the larval or immature
  condition of the higher Crinoids. <a href="#f49">Fig.&nbsp;49</a> shows one of these
  animals of somewhat later age. They have few or rudimentary arms
  and short stalks, and want the beautiful radial symmetry of the
  typical star-fishes. In the Silurian these creatures are
  reinforced by a vast number of beautiful and perfect
  feather-stars (<a href="#f50">Figs.&nbsp;50, 51</a>). These continue to increase in
  number and beauty, and apparently culminate in the Mesozoic,
  where gigantic forms exist, some of them probably having more
  complicated skeletons, in so far as number of distinct parts is
  concerned, than any other animals. Buckland has calculated that
  in a crinoid similar to that in <a href="#f52">Fig.&nbsp;52</a> there are no less
  than 150,000 little bones, and 300,000 contractile bundles of
  fibres to move them. In the modern seas the feather-stars have
  somewhat dwindled both in numbers and complexity, and are mostly
  confined to the depths of the ocean. On the other hand, the
  various types of ordinary star-fishes and sea-urchins have
  increased in number and importance. We thus find in this group a
  certain advance and improvement from the Cystideans of the Early
  Pal&aelig;ozoic to the sea-urchins and their allies. This advance
  is not, however, along one line for the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> Cystideans
  continue unimproved to the end. The Crinoids culminate in the
  Mesozoic, and are not known to give origin to anything higher.
  The star-fishes and sea-urchins commence independently, before
  the culmination of the Crinoids, and, though greatly increased in
  number and variety, still adhere very closely to their original
  types.</p>

  <p>The great sub-kingdom of the Mollusca, including the bivalve
  and univalve shell-fishes, makes its first appearance in the
  Cambrian, where its earliest representatives belong to a group,
  the Arm-bearers or Lamp shells (Brachiopods), held by some to be
  allied to worms as much as to mollusks. The oldest of all these
  shells are allies of the modern <i>Lingul&aelig;</i>
  (<a href="#f54">Fig.&nbsp;54</a>), some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64"
  id="Page_64">64</a></span> the earliest of which are shown in
  <a href="#f55">Fig.&nbsp;55</a>. The modern <i>Lingula</i> is protected by a delicate
  two-valved shell, composed, unlike that of most other mollusks,
  of phosphate of lime or bone earth. It lives on sand-banks,
  attached by its long flexible stalk, which it buries like a root
  in the bottom. Its food consists of microscopic organisms,
  drifted to its mouth by cilia placed on two arm-like processes,
  from which the group derives its name. In the modern world about
  one hundred species of Brachiopods are known, belonging to about
  twenty genera, some of which differ considerably from the
  Lingul&aelig;. The genus <i>Terebratula</i>, represented at
  <a href="#f56">Fig.&nbsp;56</a>, is one of the most common modern as well as fossil
  forms, and has the valves unequal, with a round opening in one of
  them for the stalk, which is attached to some hard object, and
  there is an internal shelly loop for supporting the arms.</p>

  <p>These curious, and in the modern seas, exceptional shells,
  were dominant in the Pal&aelig;ozoic period. Upwards of three
  thousand fossil species are known, of which a large proportion
  belong to the Cambrian and Silurian, nine genera appearing in the
  Cambrian, and no less than fifty-two in the Silurian. The history
  of these creatures is very remarkable. The Lingul&aelig;, which
  are the first to appear, continue unchanged and with the same
  phosphatic shells to the present day. Morse, who has carefully
  studied an American species, remarks in illustration of this,
  that it is exceedingly tenacious of life, bearing much change of
  depth, temperature, etc., without being destroyed. The genus
  <i>Discina</i>, which is nearly as old, also continues throughout
  geological time. The genus <i>Orthis</i> (<a href="#f57">Fig.&nbsp;57</a>), which
  appears at the same time with the last, becomes vastly abundant
  in Silurian times, but dies out altogether before the end of the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic. <i>Rhynchonella</i> (<a href="#f58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>), which comes
  in a little later, near the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> beginning of the
  Siluro-Cambrian, continues to this day. <i>Spirifer</i> and <i>Productus</i>
  (<a href="#f59">Figs.&nbsp;59 and 60</a>) appear later, and die out at the close of the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic. So strange and inscrutable are the fortunes of
  these animals, which on the whole have lost in the battle of
  life, that their place in nature is vastly less important than it
  was. It has been suggested that if any group of creatures could
  throw light upon the theory of descent with modification, it
  would be these; but Davidson, who has perhaps studied them more
  thoroughly than any other naturalist,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span> found them
  as silent on the subject as the sponges or the corals. In a
  series of papers published in the <i>Geological Magazine</i>, a
  short time before his death, he remarked as follows:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We find that the large number of genera made their
  first appearance during the Pal&aelig;ozoic periods, and since
  they have been decreasing in number to the present period. We
  will leave out of question the species, for they vary so little
  that it is often very difficult to trace really good distinctive
  characters between them; it is different with the genera, as they
  are, or should be, founded on much greater and more permanent
  distinctions. Thus, for example, the family
  <i>Spiriferid&aelig;</i> includes genera which are all
  characterised by a calcified spiral lamina for the support of the
  brachial appendages; and, however varied these may be, they
  always retain the distinctive characters of the group from their
  first appearance to their extinction. The<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
  Brachiopodist labours under the difficulties of not being able to
  determine what are the simplest, or which are the highest
  families into which either of the two great groups of his
  favourite class is divided; so far, then, he is unable to point
  out any evidence favouring progressive development in it. But,
  confining himself to species, he sees often before him great
  varietal changes, so much so as to make it difficult for him to
  define the species; and it leads him to the belief that such
  groups were not of independent origin, as was universally thought
  before Darwin published his great work on the <i>Origin of
  Species</i>. But in this respect the Brachiopoda reveal nothing
  more than other groups of the organic kingdoms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, although certain genera, such as
  <i>Terebratula</i>, <i>Rhynchonella</i>, <i>Crania</i>, and
  <i>Discina</i>, have enjoyed a very considerable geological
  existence, there are genera, such as <i>Stringocephalus</i>,
  <i>Uncites</i>, <i>Porambonites</i>, <i>Koninckina</i>, and
  several others, which made their appearance very suddenly and
  without any warning; after a while they disappeared in a similar
  abrupt manner, having enjoyed a comparatively short existence.
  They are all possessed of such marked and distinctive internal
  characters that we cannot trace between them and associated or
  synchronous genera any evidence of their being either
  modifications of one or the other, or of being the result of
  descent with modification. Therefore, although far from denying
  the possibility or probability of the correctness of the
  Darwinian theory, I could not conscientiously affirm that the
  Brachiopoda, as far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
  "Page_69">69</a></span> I am at present acquainted with them,
  would be of much service in proving it. The subject is worthy of
  the continued and serious attention of every well-informed man of
  science. The sublime Creator of the universe has bestowed on him
  a thinking mind; therefore all that can be discovered is
  legitimate. Science has this advantage, that it is continually on
  the advance, and is ever ready to correct its errors when fresh
  light or new discoveries make such necessary.&rdquo; The late
  Joachim Barrande, the great pal&aelig;ontologist of Bohemia,
  bears similar testimony.</p>

  <p>The ordinary bivalves, like the mussels and cockles, now so
  very plentiful on our coasts, are rare in the Cambrian and
  Silurian, and for the first time make a somewhat conspicuous
  appearance in the Upper Silurian and Devonian. But from the first
  they resemble very closely their modern successors, though on the
  whole neither so large nor so ornate (<a href="#f61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>). Their
  fortunes have thus been precisely the opposite of those
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id=
  "Page_70">70</a></span> the Brachiopods, though in neither case
  is there very marked elevation or deterioration in the individual
  animals. A very similar statement may be made as to the
  sea-snails, whether the curious winged snails (Pteropods) or the
  ordinary crawlers (Gastropods). The former come in early, and are
  represented by Pal&aelig;ozoic forms finer than any now extant.
  The genus <i>Conularia</i> (<a href="#f62">Fig.&nbsp;62</a>) presents some Silurian
  species six inches or more in length, which are giants in
  comparison with any now living. The forms of more ordinary
  Gastropods from the Silurian represented in <a href="#f63">Fig.&nbsp;63</a> will
  suffice to show that their styles are not very dissimilar from
  those still extant.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id=

  <p>The highest group of Mollusks, represented in the modern ocean
  by the Nautili and Cuttle-fishes, has a history so strange and
  eventful, and so different from what might have been anticipated,
  that it perhaps deserves a more detailed notice, more especially
  as Barrande has recently directed marked attention to it in his
  magnificent work on the Pal&aelig;ontology of Bohemia.</p>

  <p>The Cuttle-fishes and Squids and their allies are, in the
  modern seas, a most important group (<a href="#f64">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>). The great
  numbers in which the smaller species appear on many coasts, and
  the immense size and formidable character of others; their
  singular apparatus of arms, bearing suckers, their strange forms,
  and the inky secretion with which they can darken the water, have
  at all times attracted popular attention. The great complexity of
  their structures, and the fact that in many points they stand
  quite at the head of the invertebrates of the sea, and approach
  most nearly to the elevation of the true fishes, have secured to
  them the attention of naturalists. Some of these animals have
  shelly internal supports, and one genus, that of the Argonauts,
  or Paper Nautili, has an external protective shell. Allied,
  though more distantly, to the Cuttle-fishes, are the true
  Nautili, represented in the modern sea principally by the Pearly
  Nautilus, though there are two other species, both of them very
  rare. The modern pearly nautilus (<a href="#f65">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>) may be regarded
  as a peculiar kind of cuttle-fish provided with a discoidal shell
  for protection, and also for floatage. The shell is divided into
  a number of chambers by partitions. Of these the animal inhabits
  the last and largest. The others are empty, and are connected
  with the body of the animal only by a pipe, or siphuncle, with
  membranous walls and filled with fluid. Thus provided, the
  nautilus, when in the water, has practically no weight, and
  can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
  "Page_72">72</a></span> move up or down in the sea with the
  greatest facility, using its sucker-bearing arms and horny beak
  to seize and devour the animals on which it preys. The buoyancy
  of the shell seems exactly adapted to the weight of the animal;
  and this proportion is kept up by the addition of new
  air-chambers as the body increases in size. In the modern seas
  this singular little group stands entirely isolated, and its
  individuals are so rare that it is difficult to procure perfect
  specimens for collections, though its mechanical structure and
  advantages for the struggle for existence seem of the highest
  order. But in the old world of past geological time the case was
  altogether different.</p>

  <p>The Nautiloid shell-fishes burst suddenly upon us in the
  beginning of the Siluro-Cambrian, or Lower Silurian,
  Barrande&rsquo;s second fauna; and this applies to all the
  countries where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
  "Page_73">73</a></span> they have been studied. In this formation
  alone about 450 species are known, and in the Silurian these
  increase to 1,200; and here the group culminates. It returns in
  the Devonian to about the same number with the Lower Silurian,
  diminishes in the Carboniferous to 350, and in the Mesozoic,
  where the Nautiloid forms are replaced by others of the type of
  the Ammonites, becomes largely reduced. In the Tertiary there are
  but nineteen species, and, as already stated, in the modern world
  <i>three</i>. These statements do not, however, represent the
  whole truth. In the Pal&aelig;ozoic, in addition to the genus
  <i>Nautilus</i>, we have a great number of other genera, some
  with perfectly straight shells, like <i>Orthoceras</i>
  (<a href="#f66">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>), others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id=
  "Page_74">74</a></span> bent (<i>Cyrtoceras</i>), others
  differing in the style of siphuncle, or aperture, or chambers
  (<i>Endoceras</i>, <i>Gomphoceras</i>, <i>Lituites</i>, <a href="#f67">Figs.&nbsp;67
  to 69</a>), or inflated into sac-like forms (<i>Ascoceras</i>). There
  is, besides, the family of the <i>Goniatid&aelig;</i>
  (<a href="#f70">Fig.&nbsp;70</a>), with the chambers thrown into angular folds and
  the siphuncle at the back. Further, some of the early forms, as
  the Orthoceratid&aelig;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
  id="Page_75">75</a></span> attain to gigantic dimensions, being
  six feet or more in length, and nearly a foot in diameter. Thus
  the idea that we should naturally form from the study of the
  Nautilus, that it represents a type suited for much more varied
  and important adaptations than those that we now see, is more
  than realised in those Pal&aelig;ozoic ages when these animals
  seem to have been the lords of the seas.</p>

  <p>When we leave the Pal&aelig;ozoic and enter the Mesozoic,
  though the Nautiloid shells still abound, we find them
  superseded, in great part, by a nobler form, that of the
  <i>Ammonitid&aelig;</i> (<a href="#f71">Figs.&nbsp;71, 72</a>). These are remarkable for
  the ornate markings on the surfaces of their shells, and for the
  beautifully waved edges of the partitions (<a href="#f72">Fig.&nbsp;72</a><i>a</i>),
  which, by giving a much more complete support to the sides of the
  shell, must have contributed greatly to the union of lightness
  and strength so important to the utility of the shell as a float.
  This type admits of all the same variety of straight, bent, and
  curled forms with the simpler Nautiloid type, and some of the
  species are of great size, Ammonites being known three feet or
  more in diameter. These animals, unknown in the Pal&aelig;ozoic,
  appear in numerous species<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76"
  id="Page_76">76</a></span> in the Early Mesozoic, culminate in
  hundreds of beautiful species in the middle of that era, and
  disappear for ever at its close, leaving no modern successors.
  Many and beautiful species of Ammonites and their allies have
  been obtained from the Mesozoic rocks of British Columbia and
  other parts of the west coast of North America, perfectly
  representing this group as it occurs at the same period in
  Europe, and closely resembling the Mesozoic Ammonites of India.
  These animals have all perished, yet the Atlantic and the Pacific
  roll between, apparently with conditions as favourable for their
  comfortable existence as those of any previous time. They
  perished long ago, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77"
  id="Page_77">77</a></span> dawn of the Tertiary; yet the genus
  Nautilus, one of the oldest and least improved of the whole,
  survived, and still testifies to the wonderful contrivance
  embodied in these animals.</p>

  <p>These are merely general considerations, but Barrande, in his
  <i>&Eacute;tudes G&eacute;n&eacute;rales</i>, goes much farther.
  He sums up all the known facts in the most elaborate manner,
  considering first the embryonic characters of the shell in the
  different genera, then their distribution in space and time, then
  all the different parts and characters of the shells in the
  different groups&mdash;the whole with reference to any possible
  derivation of the species; and he finds that all leads to the
  result that in every respect these shells seem to have been so
  introduced as to make any theory of evolution with respect to
  them altogether untenable. In his concluding sentence this
  greatest of Pal&aelig;ozoic pal&aelig;ontologists<span class=

  <p>I have reserved no space to notice the geological history of
  the other and higher group of Cephalopods, including the true
  Cuttles and Squids. This is perhaps less to be regretted, as,
  from the absence of external shells, they are likely to be much
  less perfectly known as fossils. So far as known, they are vastly
  younger than the Nautiloids, for no examples whatever have been
  found in the Pal&aelig;ozoic. They appear abundantly in the
  Mesozoic, but are there represented principally by an extinct
  group of squids (Belemnites and their allies, <a href="#f74">Figs.&nbsp;74,
  74<i>a</i></a>), remarkable for the great and complicated development
  of their internal support, which has a chambered float as well as
  a solid sheath. This family becomes extinct at the close of the

  <p>The remarkable group of the Trilobites had precedence in order
  of time of the Nautiloid shell-fishes. No animal structures can
  well be more dissimilar than those of the two great groups of
  aquatic animals which popular speech confounds under the name of
  &ldquo;shell-fishes.&rdquo; Take a whelk and a crab, for example,
  and compare their general forms, the structure of their shells,
  and their organs of motion, and it is scarcely possible to
  imagine any two animals more unlike; and when we examine their
  anatomy in detail this difference does not diminish. They have,
  it is true, corresponding parts, and these parts serve similar
  uses, but in plan of structure they are wholly different. Yet
  both animals may live in the same pool, and may subsist on nearly
  the same food. If we attempt to find some common type which both
  resemble, we may trace the structure of the crab back to those of
  some of the marine worms with which it has some affinity, and
  those of the whelk to such creatures as the <i>Lingula</i>, which
  are supposed to have a resemblance to<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> the worms.
  But still the two types, that of the Mollusk and the Articulate,
  are distinct even from their first appearance in the egg, nor
  have either any close affinities with the Protozoa, the Hydroids,
  or the Corals.</p>

  and highly organised form of the Trilobite (<a href="#f28">Figs.&nbsp;28 and 75</a>).
  What older phases they may have passed through we know not; but
  in the Lower Cambrian we have various forms of these animals,
  including some of the largest known as well as some of the
  smallest; some of the most complex in number of parts as well as
  some of the simplest. These animals, in short, seem to have
  appeared at once all over the world fully formed, and in a

  very large faith in the imperfection of the geological record can
  suffice to account for their evolution.</p>

  and of modern King-crab. The Trilobite burrow is known as
  Ruschinites, and has been supposed to be a sea-weed of the kind
  called <i>Bilobites</i>.</p>

  <p>A Trilobite is a creature in whose structure the number
  three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id=
  "Page_81">81</a></span> is dominant. Seen from above, it presents
  three divisions from front to rear:&mdash;first, a cephalic
  shield or head-piece; secondly, a thorax, divided into several
  segments movable upon each other; and thirdly, a tail-piece or
  pygidium, which, when brought against the head by the rolling up
  of the body segments, effectually covers the lower parts. This
  lower portion was until lately little known; but the discoveries
  of Billings and of Wolcott have enabled us to restore the jaws
  under the head, the jointed legs and spiral gills under the
  thorax, and thus to complete the structure of the animal, and
  understand better its relations to modern crabs and shrimps
  (<a href="#f76">Fig.&nbsp;76</a>). Of these it certainly comes nearest to the
  King-crabs and Horseshoe-crabs,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> a somewhat limited group at
  present, and one which reaches back in geological time only to
  the Upper Silurian, when the Trilobites had perhaps already
  passed their culmination.</p>

  <p>Constructed as above described, the Trilobite could swim, as
  is supposed, usually on its back or side. It could crawl on the
  bottom. Using its snout as a shovel, it could burrow like a
  modern King-crab (<a href="#f76">Fig.&nbsp;76</a><i>a</i>); and when pressed by
  danger some species could roll themselves into balls and defy
  their enemies.</p>

  with little more than specific change&mdash;presenting in this a
  strange contrast to the Trilobites. While the latter were still
  flourishing, about the close of the Lower Silurian, a remarkable
  group of large and highly-developed creatures, allied to the
  Trilobites, but suited for rapid swimming rather than creeping,
  was introduced; and in the Upper Silurian and<span class=

  these creatures<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id=

  probably, any modern Crustaceans, and were tyrants of the seas.
  <i>Pterygotus anglicus</i> (<a href="#f80">Fig.&nbsp;80</a>) is supposed to have
  attained the length of six feet. Yet these noble representatives
  of the Crustaceans became extinct in the Carboniferous. On the
  other hand, a few small king-crabs appear in the Upper Silurian,
  and this type still continues, and seems to culminate as to size
  in modern times; so diverse have been the fortunes of these
  various groups.</p>

  <p>The Pal&aelig;ozoic age of geology is thus emphatically an age
  of invertebrates of the sea. In this period they were dominant in
  the waters, and until toward its close almost without rivals. We
  shall find, however, that in the Upper Silurian, fishes made
  their appearance, and in the Carboniferous amphibian reptiles,
  and that, before the close of the Pal&aelig;ozoic, vertebrate
  life in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id=
  "Page_85">85</a></span>these forms had become predominant. We
  shall also see that just as the leading groups of Mollusks and
  Crustaceans seem to have had no ancestors, so it is with the
  groups of Vertebrates which take their places. It is also
  interesting to observe that already in the Pal&aelig;ozoic all
  the types of invertebrate marine life were as fully represented
  as at present, and that this swarming marine life breaks upon us
  in successive waves as we proceed upward from the Cambrian. Thus
  the progress of life is not gradual, but intermittent, and
  consists in the sudden and rapid influx of new forms destined to
  increase and multiply in the place of those which are becoming
  effete and ready to vanish away or to sink to a lower place.
  Farther, since the great waves of aquatic life roll in with each
  great subsidence of the land, a fact which coincides with their
  appearance in the limestones of the successive periods, it
  follows that it is not struggle for existence, but expansion
  under favourable circumstances and the opening up of new fields
  of migration that is favourable to the introduction of new
  species. The testimony of pal&aelig;ontology on this point, which
  I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id=

  "FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in my judgment
  altogether subverts the prevalent theory of &ldquo;survival of
  the fittest,&rdquo; and shows that the struggle for existence, so
  far from being a cause of development and improvement, has led
  only to decay and extinction, whereas the advent of new and
  favourable conditions, and the removal of severe competition, are
  the circumstances favourable to introduction of new and advanced
  species. This testimony of the invertebrates of the sea we shall
  find is confirmed by other groups of living beings, to be noticed
  in the sequel.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id=

  <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the origin of plant life on the
  land.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/icap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "I" /><span class="smcap">f</span> the graphite of the Laurentian
  rocks was derived from vegetable matter, the further question
  arises, Was this vegetation of the land, or of the sea? and
  something may be said on both sides of this question. If there
  were land plants in the Laurentian period, they must have grown
  either on rocks older than the Laurentian itself, or on such
  portions of the beds of the latter as had been raised out of the
  sea, forming perhaps swampy flats of newly-made soil. But we know
  no rocks older than the Laurentian, and there is no positive
  evidence that any of the beds of that formation were other than
  marine. Still it is not impossible that some of the beds which
  are now graphitic gneisses may originally have been similar to
  the bituminous shales, coals, or underclays of the coal
  formation. The graphite occurring in veins, if of vegetable
  origin, must have been derived from liquid bitumen oozing into
  fissures; and veins of this kind occur in later formations, both
  in marine and fresh-water beds. The only other positive argument
  which has been adduced in favour of the existence of abundant
  land plants in the Laurentian is that of Dr. Sterry Hunt, derived
  from the great beds of iron ore, which it is difficult to account
  for chemically except on the hypothesis of the decay in the air
  of great quantities of vegetable matter. The question must remain
  in doubt till some one is fortunate enough to find<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> portions
  of the Laurentian carbon retaining traces of organic structure.
  My own observations, though somewhat numerous, allow me only to
  say that the graphite sometimes presents fibrous forms, that it
  occasionally appears as vermicular threads&mdash;which, however,
  I suppose to be fillings of canals of <i>Eozoon</i>&mdash;and that in
  the graphitic beds there are occasionally slender root-like
  bodies of a lighter colour than the mass; but none of these
  indications are sufficient to determine anything as to its
  vegetable origin, or the nature of the plants from which it may
  have been derived.</p>

  <p>In any case, the quantity of carbon which has been accumulated
  in the Laurentian rocks is very great. I have measured one bed at
  Buckingham, on the Ottawa, estimated to contain 20 per cent. of
  carbon, and which is at least eight feet in thickness. Sir
  William Logan has described another similar bed from ten to
  twelve feet thick, and more recent reports of the Geological
  Survey of Canada mention a bed supposed to be twenty-five feet
  thick, in which Mr. Hoffman finds 30 per cent. of carbon. On the
  whole the quantity of carbon in the graphitic zone of the
  Laurentian is comparable with that in certain productive
  coal-fields, and we certainly have in the subsequent geological
  history no examples of such accumulations except from remains of
  the luxuriant vegetation of swampy flats.</p>

  <p>The Upper Laurentian and Huronian have as yet afforded no
  evidence of land vegetation. The Cambrian, as already stated,
  abounds in remains of sea-weeds; but though the forms which have
  been named <i>Eophyton</i> have been regarded as land plants,
  this claim is, to say the least, very doubtful; and I have as yet
  seen nothing of this kind which did not appear to me to be merely
  markings made by objects drifted over the bottom or remains of
  marine plants. Yet in the Upper Cambrian there are wide surfaces
  of littoral sandstone often containing minute carbonised
  fragments, and which might be expected to afford indications of
  land vegetation, had such existed. I have myself<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span> devoted
  many days of fruitless labour to the examination of the large
  areas of Potsdam sandstone exposed in some parts of Canada. But
  as these rocks were evidently formed along the borders of a
  Laurentian continent capable of supporting vegetation, we may
  still hope for some discovery of this kind, more especially if we
  could find the point where some fresh-water stream ran into the
  Cambrian sea.</p>

  rather that of a land plant than of an Alga. The specimens of
  these plants which I have seen appear to me to support the
  conclusion that they represent one species, and this allied to
  the <i>Annulari&aelig;</i> of the Devonian and Carboniferous
  periods, which probably grew in shallow water with only their
  upper parts in the air, and bore whorls or verticles of narrow

  "Page_94">94</a></span>it with the pillworts, <i>Psilophyton</i>
  (<a href="#f87">Fig.&nbsp;87</a>), though more characteristic of the Devonian, has
  been found in the Upper Silurian both in Canada and the United
  States. No Ferns or Equiseta have as yet been found in the
  Silurian; but in 1870 I recognised in some fragments of wood from
  the Ludlow bone-bed, in the Museum of the Geological Survey of
  Great Britain, the structure of that curious prototypal tree, to
  which I have given the name <i>Nematophyton</i>, and which was
  first recognised in the Devonian of Gasp&eacute;. Since that time
  I have found in the Upper Silurian beds of Cape Bon Ami, in New
  Brunswick, similar fragments of fossil wood, associated with
  round seed-like bodies, having a central nucleus and a thick wall
  or test of radiating fibres. These bodies show a structure
  similar to that of those found in the Upper Ludlow of England,
  and described by Hooker under the name <i>Pachytheca</i>. In my
  judgment they are certainly true seeds.<a name="FNanchor_28_28"
  id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class=
  "fnanchor">28</a> Seeds of this kind have also been found by
  Hicks in the still older Denbighshire grits of North Wales, along
  with fragments of the wood of <i>Nematophyton</i>, and with
  remains of branching stems which have been described under the
  name <i>Berwynia</i>, though it is not unlikely that they
  represent the branches of <i>Nematophyton</i>. It is proper to
  add that these ancient vegetable fossils are regarded by some
  English botanists as gigantic alg&aelig; or sea-weeds, but I
  confess I am unable to adopt this view of their nature. The
  supposed fern of the Upper Silurian, figured in the first edition
  of this work, has proved on further examination to be merely an
  imitative form produced by crystallisation. On the other hand,
  the recent discovery of a cockroach and two species of Scorpion
  in the Silurian, proves the existence of land animals as well as
  plants at this period.</p>

  <p>It is probable that these discoveries represent merely a small
  proportion of the plants actually existing in the Silurian
  period. All the deposits of this age at present known
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=

  probably formed at a distance from land, so that it is little
  likely that land plants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96"
  id="Page_96">96</a></span> could find their way into them. At any
  time the discovery of an estuarine or lacustrine deposit of
  Silurian age might wonderfully extend our knowledge of this
  ancient flora.</p>

  <p>The Devonian or Erian age, that of the classic Old Red
  Sandstone of Scotland, is that in which we find the first great
  and complete land flora; and though this is inferior in number of
  species to that of the succeeding Carboniferous, and greatly less
  important with reference to its practical bearing on our welfare,
  it is in some respects superior in that variety which depends on
  diversity of soil and of station. To appreciate this, it will be
  necessary to glance at the range and subdivisions of the modern
  flora.</p>

  <p>In the modern world we divide all vegetation into two great
  series, that of the Flowering Plants (<i>Ph&aelig;nogams</i>),
  which also produce true fruits and seeds, and that of the
  Flowerless Plants (<i>Cryptogams</i>), which produce minute
  spores instead of seeds. The latter is in every respect the lower
  group. This lower series is again divisible into three
  classes&mdash;first and lowest, that of the Seaweeds, Moulds, and
  Lichens (Thallophytes). Secondly, that of the Mosses and their
  allies (Anophytes). Thirdly, that of the Ferns, Equisetums and
  Club-mosses (Acrogens). In like manner the second, or higher
  series is divisible into three classes: that of the Pines and
  Cycads (Gymnosperms), having naked seeds not covered by true
  fruits, and woody tissue of simple structure; that of the Palms
  and Grasses and their allies (Endogens); and last and highest,
  that of the ordinary timber trees and other plants allied to
  them, with exogenous stems, netted-veined leaves, and a
  two-leaved embryo (Exogens). These last are in every respect the
  dominant plants on our present continents. Carrying with us this
  twofold division of the vegetable kingdom and its subdivisions,
  we shall be prepared to understand the relation of the more
  ancient floras to that now living.</p>

  scarcely any that can be referred to the two higher classes of
  Ph&aelig;nogams, so that the vegetation of this period presents a
  remarkable character of mediocrity, being composed almost
  entirely of the highest class of the flowerless plants and the
  lowest class of those that flower. Of the former there are
  Tree-ferns and vast numbers of herbaceous forms (<a href="#f88">Figs.&nbsp;88, 89</a>),
  great Lycopodiaceous plants, immensely better developed than
  those now existing (<a href="#f90">Fig.&nbsp;90</a>), and gigantic <i>Calamites</i>, allied
  to the Mares&rsquo;-tails (<a href="#f91">Fig.&nbsp;91</a>), along with humbler
  members of the same group (<a href="#f95">Fig.&nbsp;95</a>). Of the latter there
  were Pines of great stature, known to us at present only by their
  wood (<a href="#f92">Fig.&nbsp;92</a>); and that other allied trees existed we have
  evidence in numerous seeds which must have belonged to this class

  4 and 5, and the medullary rays, seen in Nos. 1, 4, and 6,
  testify to the fact that this chip of wood must have belonged to
  a tree of the same type which contains our oaks, maples, and
  poplars; a type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id=
  "Page_100">100</a></span> which does not appear to have become
  dominant till near the close of the Mesozoic, but which already
  existed, though perhaps only in few species, and only in upland
  and inland positions, as far back as the Middle Devonian. Perhaps
  one of the most interesting discoveries in the Erian or
  Devonian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id=

  <p>The Devonian flora seems to have been introduced in the
  northern parts of the American continent at a time of warm and
  equable climate, and of elevation of new land out of the Silurian
  sea. It spread itself to the southward, and was finally destroyed
  in the great subsidences and disturbances which closed the
  Devonian age, and which were probably accompanied with
  refrigeration of climate. It was succeeded by the more massive
  and richer, but more monotonous flora of the Carboniferous, a
  period in which large areas of our<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span> continents were in the
  state of swampy and often submerged flats, and in which the
  climate was again warm and uniform.</p>

  <p>The Carboniferous age was, even more emphatically than the
  Devonian, an age of Acrogens and Conifers. A few Carboniferous
  Fungi have recently been discovered, but there are no known
  Lichens or Mosses. There seem to be a few Endogens, but no true
  Exogens. The great bulk of the plants consists of Acrogens and
  Gymnosperms, as in the previous period. As this flora is so very
  important and so much better known than any other of those
  belonging to the infancy of the vegetable kingdom, we may notice
  a little in detail some of its leading forms.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the Mares&rsquo;-tails, we find these
  represented in the Carboniferous by many gigantic species,
  attaining to almost <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
  "Page_105">104<br />
  105</a></span> tree-like dimensions (<a href="#f96">Fig.&nbsp;96</a>). These are the
  <i>Calamites</i>, which formed dense brakes and jungles on the margins
  of the great swampy flats of this period. Their tall stems,
  ribbed and jointed, bore whorls of leaves or branchlets. Sending
  out horizontal root-stocks and budding out from the base, they
  grew in great clumps, and had the capacity to resist the effects
  of accumulating sediment by constantly sending out new stems at
  higher and higher levels. The larger species assumed a complexity
  in the structure of their stems unknown in their modern
  congeners, and enabling them to grow to a great height;<a name=
  "FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> but their foliage and
  fructification were not correspondingly advanced. Thus the family
  of the Equisetace&aelig; culminated <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>in the
  Carboniferous, and thenceforth descended gradually in the
  succeeding ages, leaving the comparatively humble
  Mares&rsquo;-tails and Scouring Rushes as its present
  representatives.</p>

  <p>The Ferns of the Carboniferous, like those of the Devonian,
  presented both gigantic forms like those of the tree-ferns of the
  modern tropics, and delicate herbaceous species, and these in
  great profusion. On the whole, they do not strike the observer as
  very dissimilar from those of modern times. A more critical
  examination, however, shows that the bulk of the tree-ferns of
  the Devonian and Carboniferous are allied not to the Polypod
  type, which is the most common at present, but to certain
  comparatively rare southern ferns, the <i>Marattias</i> and their
  allies, characterised by a peculiar style of fructification,
  perhaps adapting them to a moist and warm atmosphere
  (<a href="#f97">Fig.&nbsp;97</a>).<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id=
  "FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class=
  "fnanchor">32</a> Thus the ferns, while a wonderfully persistent
  type, were in their grander forms far more widely distributed in
  the Carboniferous than at present; and genera now comparatively
  rare, and limited to warm and moist climates, were then abundant,
  and ranged over those temperate and boreal regions of the
  Northern Hemisphere where only a few humble and hardy species can
  now subsist. There were also some remarkable and anomalous
  tree-ferns, of which that represented in <a href="#f98">Fig.&nbsp;98</a> is an
  example.</p>

  <p>The family of the Club-mosses, already, even in the Devonian,
  in advance of its modern development, experiences in the
  Carboniferous a remarkable and portentous extension into great
  trees of several genera and many species, constituting apparently
  extensive forests, and having the woody tissues of their stems
  developed to a degree unheard of in their present representatives
  (<a href="#f99">Fig.&nbsp;99</a>). Further, they become closely linked, in external
  form at least, with another and more advanced type, that of the
  <i>Sigillari&aelig;</i>. These remarkable trees were the most
  abundant of all in the swamps of the coal-formation, and probably
  those <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id=
  "Page_107">107</a></span>which most contributed to the
  accumulation of coal. They presented tall pillar-like trunks,
  often ribbed longitudinally, and with perpendicular rows of scars
  of fallen leaves. Dividing at top into a few thick branches, they
  were covered with long rigid grass-like foliage. Their fruit was
  borne in rings or whorls of spikes surrounding the branches at
  intervals (<a href="#f100">Fig.&nbsp;100</a>). Their roots were strangely symmetrical,
  spreading out like underground branches into the soft soil by a
  regular process of bifurcation, and were covered with rootlets
  diverging in every direction, and so jointed to the main root
  that when broken off they left round marks regularly arranged.
  These <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id=
  "Page_108">108<br />
  109<br />
  110</a></span> roots are the so-called <i>Stigmari&aelig;</i>, so
  abundant in every coal-field, and especially filling the
  &ldquo;under-clays&rdquo; of the coal-beds, which are the soils
  on which the plants forming these beds were supported. The true
  botanical position of the <i>Sigillari&aelig;</i> has been a
  matter of much controversy. Some of them undoubtedly have
  structures akin to those of the tree-like Club-mosses, as
  Williamson has well shown, and may have been cryptogamous. Others
  have structures of higher character, akin to those of the modern
  Cycads, and seem to have borne nutlets allied to those of these
  plants. Yet the external forms of these diverse sorts are so
  similar that no definite separation of them has yet been made.
  Either these anomalous trees constitute a link connecting the two
  great series of the vegetable kingdom, or we have been
  confounding two distinct groups, owing to imperfect
  information.</p>

  <p>Another curious, and till recently little understood, group of
  Carboniferous trees is that known as <i>Cordaites</i>, which
  existed already in some of its species in the Devonian. Their
  leaves are long, and often broad as well, and with numerous
  delicate parallel veins, resembling in this the leaves of
  grasses. Corda long ago showed that one species at least has a
  stem allied to the Club-mosses. More recently Grand&rsquo; Eury
  has found in the South of France admirably preserved specimens,
  which show that others more resembled in their structure the
  Pines and Yews, and were probably Gymnosperms, approaching to the
  Pines, but with very peculiar and exceptional foliage, of which
  the only modern examples are the broad-leaved Pines of the genus
  <i>Dammara</i> (Frontispiece to Chapter). Here again we have
  either two very distinct groups, combined through our ignorance,
  or a connecting link between the Lycopods and the Pines.</p>

  <p>The Yews and their allies among modern trees, while members of
  the great Cone-bearing order, bear nut-like seeds in fleshy
  envelopes, sometimes, as in the G&iacute;nkgo of Japan,
  constituting edible fruits. Seeds of this type seem to have
  been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id=
  "Page_111">111</a></span> extremely abundant in the Carboniferous
  age in all parts of the world, and were probably produced by
  trees of several genera (<i>Dadoxylon</i>, <i>Sigillaria</i>,
  <i>Cordaites</i>, etc.) (<a href="#f101">Fig.&nbsp;101</a>). Charles Brongniart has
  recently described no less than seventeen genera of these seeds
  from the coal-field of St. &Eacute;tienne alone, and it would be
  a low estimate to say that we probably know as many as sixty or
  seventy species in all, while the trunks of great coniferous
  trees allied to Taxine&aelig;, and showing well-preserved
  structure, are by no means uncommon in the Devonian and
  Carboniferous. Had these great Yews appeared for the first time
  in the Coal-formation, we might have supposed that they had been
  developed from such Lycopods as Lepidodendra, and that the
  <i>Cordaites</i> are the intermediate<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> forms; but unfortunately
  the Pines go almost as far back in geological time as the
  Lycopods, and it does not help us, when in search of evidence of
  evolution, to find the link which is missing or imperfect in the
  Early Devonian supplied in the Coal-formation, where, for this
  purpose at least, it is no longer needed.</p>

  <p>We have said something of what was in the Pal&aelig;ozoic
  flora; but what of that which was not? We may
  answer:&mdash;Nearly all that is characteristic of our modern
  forests, whether in the ordinary Exogens, which predominate so
  greatly in the trees and shrubs of temperate climates, or in the
  Palms and their allies, which figure so conspicuously within the
  tropics. The few rare, and to some extent doubtful,
  representatives of these types scarcely deserve to be noted as
  exceptions. Had a botanist searched the Pal&aelig;ozoic forests
  for precursors of the future, he would probably have found only a
  few rare species, while he would have seen all around him the
  giant forms and peculiar and monotonous foliage of tribes now
  degraded in magnitude and structure, and of small account in the
  system of nature.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that the Pal&aelig;ozoic flora
  remained in undisturbed possession of the continents during the
  whole of that long period. In the successive subsidences of the
  continental plateaux, in which the marine limestones were
  deposited, it was to a great extent swept away, or was restricted
  to limited insular areas, and these more especially in the far
  north, so that on re-elevation of the land it was always peopled
  with northern plants. Thus there were alternate restrictions and
  expansions of vegetation, and the latter were always signalised
  by the introduction of new species, for here, as elsewhere, it
  was not struggle, but opportunity, that favoured improvement.</p>

  <p>In the Lower Silurian such plants as existed must have
  experienced great restriction at the age of the Niagara or
  Wenlock limestone. Those of the Upper Silurian suffered a similar
  reverse at the time of the Lower Helderberg or Ludlow
  lime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
  "Page_113">113</a></span>stones. This recurred at the close of
  the Devonian and in the time of the Lower Carboniferous
  limestone; and finally the Pal&aelig;ozoic flora disappeared
  altogether in the Permian, to be replaced by new types in the
  Mesozoic. While, therefore, there is a great general similarity
  in the successive Pal&aelig;ozoic floras, there are minor
  differences, so that the Devonian plants are for the most part
  distinct specifically from those of the Lower Carboniferous,
  those of the Lower Carboniferous from those of the
  Coal-formation, and those of the latter from those of the
  Permian.</p>

  <p>With all these vicissitudes it is to be observed that there is
  no apparent elevation of type in all the long ages from the
  Devonian to the Permian, that the Acrogens and Gymnosperms of
  these periods are in some respects superior, in all respects
  equal, to their modern successors, and that their history shows a
  decadence toward the modern period; that intermediate forms
  arrive too late to form connecting links in time, that several
  distinct types appear together at the beginning, and that all
  utterly and apparently simultaneously perish at the end of the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic, to make way for the entirely new vegetation of
  the succeeding age. Theories of evolution receive no support from
  facts like these, though their practical significance, as parts
  of the one great uniform scheme of nature, is sufficiently
  manifest.</p>

  <p>Of what use then were these old floras? To the naturalist,
  vegetable life, with regard to its modern uses, is the great
  accumulator of pabulum for the sustenance of the higher forms of
  vital energy manifested in the animal. In the Pal&aelig;ozoic
  this consideration sinks in importance. In the Coal period we
  know few land animals, and these not vegetable feeders, with the
  exception of some insects, millipedes, and snails. But the
  Carboniferous forests did not live in vain, if their only use was
  to store up the light and heat of those old summers in the form
  of coal, and to remove the excess of carbonic acid from the
  atmosphere. In the Devonian period<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> even these utilities
  fail, for coal does not seem to have been accumulated to any
  great extent, and the petroleum of the Devonian appears to have
  been produced from aquatic vegetation. Even with reference to
  theories of evolution, there seems no necessity for the long
  continuance and frequent changes of species of acrogenous plants
  without any perceptible elevation. We may have much yet to learn
  of the life of the Devonian; but for the present the great plan
  of vegetable nature goes beyond our measures of utility; and
  there remains only what is perhaps the most wonderful and
  suggestive correlation of all, namely, that our minds, made in
  the image of the Creator, are able to trace in these perished
  organisms structures similar to those of modern plants, and thus
  to reproduce in imagination the forms and habits of growth of
  living things which so long preceded us on the earth. We may
  indeed proceed a step further, and hold that, independently of
  human appreciation, these primitive plants commended themselves
  to the approval of their Maker, and perhaps of higher
  intelligences unknown to us; and that in the last resort it was
  for His pleasure that they were created.<span class=

  <h4><span class="smcap">the appearance of vertebrate
  animals.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/ccap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "C" /><span class="smcap">onfessedly</span> the highest style of
  animal is that which possesses a skull and backbone, with brain
  and nerve system to match, and which embodies the general plan of
  structure employed in man himself. Yet among the fishes, which
  constitute the lowest manifestation of this type, are some so
  rudimentary that the brain is scarcely developed, and the
  skeleton is merely a cord of gristle. These are represented in
  the modern world only by the Lancelot,<a name="FNanchor_33_33"
  id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class=
  "fnanchor">33</a> a creature which has sometimes been mistaken
  for a worm, and by a slightly more advanced type, that of the
  Lampreys.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id=
  "FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class=
  "fnanchor">34</a> In these animals the Vertebrates make the
  nearest approach to the lower domains of the animal kingdom,
  collectively known as Invertebrates. We should naturally expect
  that since the vertebrates succeed the inferior animals in time,
  their lower types should appear first, and that these should be
  aquatic rather than terrestrial. On the other hand, as the oldest
  fishes that are certainly known are strongly protected with bony
  armour, and had to contend against formidable Crustaceans and
  Cuttles, we might suppose that the Lancelot and the Lampreys are
  rather degraded types belonging to the modern period, than the
  true precursors of the other fishes.</p>

  <p>But if fishes like the Lancelot preceded all others, we may
  never find in a fossil state any traces of their soft and
  perishable bodies; and even the Lampreys have no hard parts
  except small horny teeth, which might easily escape observation.
  But pal&aelig;ontologists have sharp eyes, and it has not escaped
  them that certain microscopic tooth-like bodies are somewhat
  widely distributed in the older rocks. In Russia, Pander has
  found in the Upper Cambrian and Lower Silurian, and also in the
  Devonian and Carboniferous, minute conical and comb-like teeth,
  to which he has given the name of <i>Conodonts</i>
  (<a href="#f102">Fig.&nbsp;102</a>), and which he supposes to be the teeth of ancient
  Lampreys. Similar teeth have been found by Moore and others in
  the Carboniferous of England, and by Newberry in Carboniferous
  shales in Ohio. In point of form, these bodies certainly resemble
  the teeth of the humble fishes to which they have been referred.
  In the case of the Carboniferous specimens from Ohio&mdash;the
  only ones I have had an opportunity to examine<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>the
  material is calcium phosphate, and the structures are more like
  those of teeth of Sharks than of Lampreys, so that there can be
  no doubt that they are really teeth of fishes, and probably of
  fishes of somewhat higher grade than the Lampreys.<a name=
  "FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The Cambrian and
  Silurian specimens are said to be composed of calcium carbonate,
  which would render it more probable that, as has been suggested
  by Prof. Owen, they may have been teeth of some species of
  Sea-snail destitute of shell. It is, however, possible that they
  may have originally been horny, and that the animal matter has
  been replaced by carbonate of lime. Rohon and Zittel have
  recently shown that many of these are more allied to the teeth of
  worms than of any other animals.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id=

  <p>If these older Conodonts were really teeth of fishes, they
  carry the introduction of these nearly as far back as that of the
  Mollusks and Crustaceans. If they were not, then the earliest
  known representatives of this class belong to a much later age,
  that of the Silurian. Here we have undoubted remains of fishes
  belonging to two of the higher orders of the class; and in the
  succeeding Devonian these became multiplied and extended
  exceedingly.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

  <p>Besides the inferior tribes already referred to, the modern
  seas and rivers present four leading types of
  fishes:&mdash;first, the ordinary bony fishes (Teleostians), such
  as the Cod, Salmon, and Herring; secondly, the Ganoid fishes,
  protected with bony plates on the skin, as the Bony-pike<a name=
  "FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and Sturgeon; thirdly,
  the Sharks and their allies, the Dog-fishes and Rays; fourthly,
  the peculiar and at present rare group of semi-reptilian fishes
  to which the name of <i>Dipnoi</i> has been given, on account of
  their capacity for breathing both in air and in water.</p>

  <p>Of these four types the first is altogether modern, and
  includes the great majority of our present fishes. It does not
  make its appearance till the Cretaceous age, and then is at once
  represented by at least three of the modern families, those of
  the Salmon, Herring, and Perch. The history of the other three
  groups is precisely the opposite of this. They abound exceedingly
  at an early period, and dwindle to a much smaller number in the
  modern time. This is especially the case with the Ganoids and the
  Dipnoi. It is also remarkable that these groups of old-fashioned
  fishes<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> are in some respects
  the highest members of the class, approaching the nearest to the
  reptiles; but this accords with a well-known
  pal&aelig;ontological law, namely, that the higher members of low
  groups give way on the introduction of more elevated types, while
  the lower members may continue. Thus the decadence of these
  higher fish begins with the incoming of the reptiles, just as the
  decadence of the higher Mollusks and predaceous Crustaceans began
  with the incoming of the fishes. Further, the modern Ganoids and
  Dipnoi are mostly fresh-water animals, though the Sharks are
  largely pelagic. In the Pal&aelig;ozoic there seem to have been
  abundance of marine species of all these types; but though
  marine, they probably flourished most in bays and estuaries and
  on shallow banks; and the existence of these implies continental
  masses of land. This explains the curious coincidence that the
  introduction of fishes and of an abundant land flora synchronise,
  and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id=
  "Page_121">121</a></span>that the ocean was still dominated by
  Invertebrates long after the fishes had become supreme in bays,
  estuaries, and rivers.</p>

  <p>The first fishes that we certainly know are the Ganoids and
  Sharks, which appear near the close of the Upper Silurian, in the
  English Ludlow for example (<a href="#f104">Fig.&nbsp;104</a>). The Ganoids found
  here all belong to an extinct group, characterised by the
  covering of the head and anterior part of the body with large
  bony plates. They are mostly small fishes, and probably fed at
  the bottom, and used their long or rounded bony snouts for
  grubbing in the mud for food. In this respect they present a
  singular resemblance to the Trilobites, so that we seem to have
  here animals of an entirely new type, the Vertebrate, and with
  bony instead of shelly coverings, taking up the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
  and, to some extent, the external form of a group about to pass
  away. Yet I presume that no derivationist would be hardy enough
  to affirm that the Trilobites could have been the ancestors of
  these fishes. Nor indeed is any ancestry even hypothetically
  known for them, for the doubtful Lampreys of the Cambrian
  Silurian are too remote and uncertain to be used in that
  way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id=

  <a href="#f104">Fig.&nbsp;104</a>, and the restoration after Lankester in the

  curious primitive Ganoids, which are continued in the Devonian
  fishes represented in <a href="#f105">Figs.&nbsp;105, 106</a>.</p>

  <p>Along with these, and not improbably their enemies, were
  certain Sharks (<a href="#f104">Fig.&nbsp;104</a>), known to us only by the spines
  which were attached to their fins as weapons of defence, and by
  detached bony tubercles which protected their skin. These remains
  are chiefly interesting as indications that two of the great
  leading divisions of the class of fishes originated together.</p>

  <p>In the Devonian age the Ganoids and Sharks, thus introduced in
  the Silurian, may be said to culminate. The former,
  more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id=
  "Page_123">123</a></span> especially, are represented by a great
  variety of species, some of them nearly allied to their Silurian
  predecessors (<a href="#f106">Fig.&nbsp;106</a>), others of forms and structure not
  dissimilar to those of the few surviving representatives of the
  order, or altogether peculiar to the Devonian (<a href="#f107">Fig.&nbsp;107</a>). So
  numerous are these fishes, and of so many genera and
  species&mdash;and this not merely in one region, but in widely
  separated parts of the world&mdash;that the Devonian has not
  inaptly been called the reign of Ganoids. As an illustration at
  once of the very peculiar forms of some of these fishes and of
  their wide distribution, I figure here along with the British
  species a <i>Cephalaspis</i> (<a href="#f105">Fig.&nbsp;105</a>) found in the Lower
  Devonian of Gasp&eacute;, in the same beds with some of the
  antique Devonian plants described in the last chapter.</p>

  <p>A new and interesting light has recently been cast upon some
  of the most anomalous of the ancient fishes by the study of the
  now rare and peculiar species of the group of Dipnoi. Two of
  these, belonging to the genus <i>Lepidosiren</i>, are
  the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id=
  "Page_124">124</a></span> &ldquo;Mud-fishes&rdquo; of the rivers
  of tropical Africa and America (<a href="#f108">Fig.&nbsp;108</a>,&nbsp;<i>b.</i>) These
  creatures have an elongated and elegant form, and the body is
  covered with overlapping horny scales like those of ordinary
  fishes; but the pectoral and ventral fins are rod-like, and are
  supported by simple cartilaginous rays, while the tailfin forms a
  fringe around the posterior part of the body.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> Unlike
  ordinary fishes, they have lungs as well as gills, and their
  mouths are armed with sharp, bony, beak-like teeth (<a href="#f115">Fig.&nbsp;115</a>),
  with which they can inflict terrible bites on the small fishes
  and frogs which furnish them with food. Their most remarkable
  habit is that of burying themselves in the mud of dried-up ponds,
  thus forming a sort of water-chamber or &ldquo;cocoon,&rdquo; in
  which they remain in a torpid state until the return of the rainy
  season sets them free.</p>

  <p>Another example of these Dipnoi is the Barramunda, or
  <i>Ceratodus</i> of the Australian rivers
  (<a href="#f108">Fig.&nbsp;108</a><i>a</i>). This fish resembles the <i>Lepidosiren</i> in
  many essential points of structure; but its fins have lateral
  rays, and are consequently of some breadth, though of peculiar
  form, and its mouth is armed with flat, pavement-like teeth,
  wherewith it browses on aquatic grasses.</p>

  <p>These modern fishes have enabled us to understand several
  mysterious forms met with in the older rocks. In the first place,
  they show the meaning of certain flat-toothed fishes, like
  <i>Dipterus</i> of the Devonian (<a href="#f109">Fig.&nbsp;109</a>), <i>Conchodus</i>
  of the Carboniferous (<a href="#f110">Fig.&nbsp;110</a>), and <i>Ceratodus</i> of the
  Carboniferous and Trias (<a href="#f111">Figs.&nbsp;111, 112</a>), previously of very
  doubtful character. These must all have been of similar structure
  and habits with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id=
  "Page_126">126</a></span> the Barramunda, which is thus the sole
  survivor, perhaps itself verging on extinction, of a group of
  herbivorous fishes introduced, it may be, contemporaneously with
  the first stream affording the requisite vegetable food, and
  which have continued almost without improvement or deterioration
  to the present time. These fishes are, however, very closely
  connected with the Ganoids, and there are some of these, with
  fringed fins and overlapping scales, which, while regarded as
  true Ganoids, resemble the Dipnoi very closely.</p>

  <p>We are thus enabled to see in the streams, lakes, and bays of
  the Pal&aelig;ozoic, harmless fishes, of the type of <i>Ceratodus</i>,
  feeding on plants, and huge precursors of the Mud-fishes darting
  from the depths, and provided with a dental apparatus more
  formidable than that of any modern fish, sufficient to pierce the
  strongest armour of the Ganoids, and to destroy and devour the
  largest aquatic animals. These huge fishes, armed with shears two
  or three feet in length, and capable of cutting asunder scale,
  flesh, and bone, are the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of destructive
  monsters of the deep, far surpassing our modern Sharks; and if,
  by means of supplementary lungs, they could breathe in air as

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>Newberry has well remarked that while in
  the Devonian the Ganoids and Dipnoi were the real tyrants of the
  sea, as well as of the streams, in the Carboniferous they already
  diminish in size, though still abundant as to numbers, and are
  more limited to estuaries and fresh waters. Thus their departure
  from power had already begun, and went on until in modern times
  the proportion of Ganoids to ordinary fishes is, according to
  G&uuml;nther, nine out of 9,000. The Carboniferous, indeed, very
  specially abounds in small Ganoids, though there are many large
  and formidable species. One of these smaller species, a very
  beautiful little fish, of fresh-water ponds and streams in the
  older part of the Carboniferous age, is represented of the
  natural size in <a href="#f116">Fig.&nbsp;116</a>, and is not a restoration, being

  <p>The Sharks in the Carboniferous increase in number and
  importance. <a href="#f117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a> shows a few examples of their teeth and
  spines. In the Carboniferous, however, there is a
  great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
  "Page_130">130</a></span> preponderance of those species with
  flat, crushing teeth fitted for grinding shells,<a name=
  "FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> which in diminishing
  numbers continue up to the present time, when they are
  represented by the Port Jackson Shark and a few other species.
  The increase toward the modern time of the true Sharks<a name=
  "FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> with sharp cutting
  teeth, is obviously related to the increase of the ordinary
  fishes which furnish them with food. Another curious difference,
  connected probably with the same circumstance, is the fact that
  in the sharp toothed Sharks of the Carboniferous the two side
  fangs of each tooth are the largest, or are exclusively developed
  (<a href="#f117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>, <i>a</i>), while in later periods the central
  point becomes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id=
  "Page_131">131</a></span>dominant, or is developed to the
  exclusion of the others (<a href="#f118">Figs.&nbsp;118, 119</a>).</p>

  <p>The Ganoids and Dipnoi still, however, occupy a very important
  place through the Mesozoic ages (<a href="#f120">Fig.&nbsp;120</a>), and it is only
  at the close of the Cretaceous that they finally give place to
  the Teleosts, or common fishes, which, though perhaps more fully
  specialised in purely ichthyic features, have dropped the
  reptilian characteristics of <span class="figright" style=
  "width: 250px;"><a name="f118" id="f118"></a><img src=
  "images/fig_118.png" width="250" height="411" alt=

  "center2"><span class="smcap"><a href="#f118">Fig.&nbsp;118</a>.</span>&mdash;Teeth
  of Cretaceous Sharks (<i>Otodus</i> and
  <i>Ptychodus</i>).&mdash;After Leidy.</span></span> their
  predecessors (<a href="#f121">Fig.&nbsp;121</a>). It is interesting to observe that
  these old-fashioned fishes had culminated before the advent of
  air-breathing Vertebrates, which appear for the first time in the
  Carboniferous. It is further to be observed that groups of fishes
  furnished with means of aiding their gills by rudimentary lungs
  were especially suited to waters more charged with carbonic acid,
  and less with free oxygen, than those of more recent times. This
  remark especially applies to the mephitic and sluggish streams
  and lagoons of the Carboniferous swamps, where, in the midst of a
  rank vegetation and reeking masses of decaying organic matter,
  the half air-breathing fishes and the amphibious reptilian
  animals met with each other and found equally congenial abodes.
  Thus, independently of the fact that some of these fishes were
  probably vegetable feeders, it is not altogether an accident, but
  a wise adaptation, that caused the culmination of the reptilian
  fishes and batrachian reptiles to coincide with the enormous
  development of the lower forms<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span> of land-plants in the
  Devonian and Carboniferous. Another curious illustration of the
  diminishing necessity for air-breathing to the fishes, is the
  change of the tail from the unequally-lobed <span class="figleft"
  style="width: 200px;"><a name="f119" id="f119"></a><img src=
  "images/fig_119.png" width="200" height="237" alt=

  "center2"><span class="smcap"><a href="#f119">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>.</span>&mdash;Tooth
  of a Tertiary Shark (<i>Carcharodon</i>).</span></span> or
  heterocercal form, which prevailed in the Pal&aelig;ozoic, to the
  more modern equally-lobed (homocercal) style in the Mesozoic. The
  former is better suited to animals which have to rise rapidly to
  the surface for air, and is still continued in some modern
  fishes, which for other reasons need to ascend and descend, or to
  turn themselves in the water; but the homocercal form is best
  suited to the ordinary fish, whether Ganoids or Teleosts
  (<a href="#f122">Fig.&nbsp;122</a>). It is curious also to find the beginning of the
  dominancy of the ordinary fish to coincide with that of the
  broad-leaved exogenous trees in the later Cretaceous, and to
  precede immediately the appearance of the mammals on the land;
  all these changes being related to the purer air, the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> clearer
  waters, and the more varied continental profiles of the later
  geological periods. Thus physical improvement and the changes of
  animal and vegetable life are linked together by correlations
  which imply not only design, but prescience, whether we attribute
  these qualities to a spiritual Creator or to mere atoms and
  forces.</p>

  <p>The history of fishes extends further through geological time
  than that of any other Vertebrates, and is perhaps more
  completely known to us, in consequence of the greater facilities
  for the preservation of their remains in aqueous deposits. If we
  receive Pander&rsquo;s Conodonts as indicating a low type
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id=
  "Page_134">134</a></span> cartilaginous fishes, these must have
  continued for vast ages without any elevation, and struggling for
  a bare existence amidst formidable Cuttle-fishes and Crustaceans,
  before, under more favourable conditions, they suddenly expanded
  into the high and perfect types of Ganoids and Sharks. If we
  reject the early Conodonts, then the two last-mentioned types
  spring together and suddenly into existence, like the armed men
  from the dragon&rsquo;s teeth of Cadmus. They rapidly attain to
  numbers and grandeur unexampled in later times, and become the
  lords of the waters at the time when there was probably no
  Vertebrate life on the land. As the reptiles establish themselves
  on the land and in the waters, the Ganoids diminish, but the
  Sharks hold their own. At length the reign of reptiles is over,
  but the Ganoids, instead of resuming their pristine numbers, give
  place to the Teleosts, and become reduced to insignificance;
  while the Sharks, profiting by the decadence of the great marine
  reptiles, remain the tyrants of the seas. This history is
  strangely unlike a continuous evolution; but we are anticipating
  facts which will fall to be discussed in a subsequent
  chapter.</p>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the first air-breathers.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/wcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "W" /><span class="smcap">ere</span> our experience limited to
  the animals whose remains are found in the earlier
  Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks, we might be unable to conceive the
  possibility of an animal capable of living and breathing in the
  thin and apparently uncongenial medium of air. More especially
  would this appear doubtful if our experience of the atmosphere
  presented it to us as loaded with carbonic acid, and less rich in
  vital air than it is at present. Even the mechanical difficulties
  of the case might strike us as considerable, in our ignorance of
  the capabilities of limbs. Still, as time wore on, we should find
  this problem worked out along three distinct lines of
  advancement&mdash;those of the Mollusk, the Arthropod, and the
  Vertebrate, and in each of these with different machinery,
  related to the previous locomotive and water-breathing apparatus
  of the type.</p>

  <p>Respiration under water depends, not on the water itself, but
  on the small percentage of free oxygen which it contains, and
  this is utilised for the a&euml;ration of the blood of animals,
  by that wonderful and often extremely beautiful apparatus of
  delicate fibres or lamin&aelig; penetrated with blood-vessels,
  which we call a gill. Except those lowest creatures which
  a&euml;rate their blood merely at the general surface of the
  body, all animals capable of respiration in water are provided
  with gills in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id=
  "Page_138">138</a></span> form, though in many of the humbler
  types, like that of the familiar Oyster, the gills are used for
  the double purpose of a&euml;rating the blood and, by their
  minute vibrating threads or cilia, drifting food to the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>In the great group of radiated animals, the <i>Protozoa</i>,
  <i>C&oelig;lenterata</i>, and <i>Echinodermata</i>, no
  air-breathing creature exists, or, in so far as is known, has
  existed, so that this vast group of animals is limited altogether
  to the waters; and this is undoubtedly one mark of its
  inferiority.</p>

  <p>In the sub-kingdom of the Mollusks the highest class, that of
  the Cuttle-fishes and Nautili, has been, singularly enough,
  rejected as unfit for this promotion, though it was early
  introduced, and attains to a high development of muscular energy
  and nervous power. The group next in order, that of the Snails
  and their allies, alone ventures in some of its families to
  assume the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of air-breathing. As might be
  expected, in creatures of this stamp the simplest means are
  employed to effect the result. In the sub-aquatic species the
  gills are contained in a chamber, where they are protected and
  kept supplied with water. In the air-breathing species, this
  gill-chamber is merely emptied of its contents and converted into
  an air-sac or functional lung. Thus a rude and imperfect method
  of air-breathing is contrived, which scarcely separates the
  animals that possess it from their aquatic relatives, but which
  nevertheless gives to us the beautiful and varied groups of the
  Land-snails and of the air-breathing fresh-water Snails.</p>

  <p>In the worms and Crustaceans the gills are placed at the sides
  of the body, and connected with its several segments. But the
  Crustaceans, like the Cuttle-fishes, though the highest aquatic
  type, never become air-breathers. It is true some of them, like
  the Land-crabs, live in the air; but they retain their gills, and
  have to carry with them a supply of water to keep these
  moist.</p>

  <p>But in order to elevate the Annulose type to the true dignity
  of air breathing, three new classes had to be introduced,
  differing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
  "Page_139">139</a></span> altogether in their details of
  structure; and all three seem to have been placed on the earth
  about the same time. They are: First, the Myriapods, or
  Gallyworms and Centipedes; secondly, the Insects; and thirdly,
  the Arachnidans, or Spiders and Scorpions.</p>

  <p>In the Myriapods a system of air-tubes, kept open by elastic
  spiral fibres, penetrates the body by lateral pores, thus
  retaining the resemblance to the lateral respiration of the
  Crustaceans and worms. In the Insects, where this type of
  structure rises to its highest mechanical perfection, and where
  the animal is enabled to be not merely an air-breather, but a
  flier, the same system of lateral pores and internal air-tubes is
  adopted, and is so extended and ramified as to give a very
  perfect respiration. In the Spiders and Scorpions the system is
  the same, except that in the latter and a part of the former the
  whole or a part of the tracheal system becomes expanded into
  air-chambers simulating true lungs.</p>

  <p>Among the Vertebrates, the fishes are breathers by gills
  attached to arches at the sides of the neck. But already in the
  Devonian we have reason to believe that there were fishes having
  the swimming-bladder opening into the back of the mouth to
  receive air, and divided into chambers, so as to constitute an
  imperfect lung. And here we have not, as in the lower types, an
  adaptation of the old water-breathing organs, but an entirely new
  apparatus. In the next grade of Vertebrates we find, as in the
  Frogs, Water-lizards, etc., that the young are aquatic and
  breathe by gills, while the adults acquire lungs, sometimes
  retaining their gills also, but in the higher forms parting with
  them. Thus in the vertebrates alone we have true lungs, distinct
  structurally from gills; and these lungs attain to their highest
  perfection in the birds and mammals.</p>

  <p>The oldest air breathers at present known are Scorpions and
  insects allied to the modern May-flies, which have been found in
  the Silurian. Next to these, and more important in
  number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
  "Page_140">140</a></span> and variety, are the insects of the
  Erian plant beds of New Brunswick. They were discovered by the
  late lamented Prof. C. F. Hartt in the plant-bearing shales of
  the Middle Devonian (<a href="#f123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>). The beds containing them
  hold also a species of <i>Eurypterus</i>, an obscure Trilobite,
  and a Crustacean allied to the modern Stomapods,<a name=
  "FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> besides a shell which
  may possibly be that of a Land-snail, to be mentioned in the
  sequel. They are also exceedingly rich in beautifully-preserved
  remains of Devonian plants. The collection made by Prof. Hartt is
  limited to a few fragments of wings; but these, in the skilful
  hands of Mr. Scudder, have proved to be rich in geological
  interest. One is a gigantic <i>Ephemera</i> or May-fly, which
  must have been five inches in the expanse of the wings, which are
  more complex in their venation than those of its modern allies
  (<a href="#f123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>, <i>a</i>). Another presents peculiarities between
  those of the May-flies and Dragon-flies (<a href="#f123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>,
  <i>b</i>). A third is a Neuropter, not belonging to any known
  family, but allied to some in the Coal-formation (<a href="#f123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>,
  <i>c</i>). A fourth (<a href="#f123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>, <i>d</i>) <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>is a
  small and delicate wing, supposed to have belonged to an animal
  having some points of resemblance to the modern crickets. Two
  others are represented by mere fragments of wings, insufficient
  to determine their affinities with certainty. No other insects of
  this age have been discovered elsewhere; but it is to be borne in
  mind that no other locality rich in Devonian plants has probably
  been so thoroughly explored. The hard slaty ridges containing
  these fossils are well exposed on the coast near the city of St.
  John, and Messrs. Hartt and Matthew of that city, acting, I
  believe, in concert with and aided by the Natural History Society
  of the place, not only searched superficially, but removed by
  blasting large portions of the richest beds, and examined every
  fragment with the greatest care. Their primary object was fossil
  plants, of which they obtained magnificent collections; and it is
  scarcely possible that the insects could have been found but for
  the exhaustive methods of exploration employed.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to observe, respecting these oldest insects,
  that they all belong to those families which have jaws, and not
  suctorial apparatus, that they are not of those which undergo a
  complete metamorphosis, and that their modern congeners pass
  their larval stage in the water. Thus the waters gave birth to
  the first insects, and their earliest families were not of those
  which suck honied juices or the blood of animals, or which pass
  through a worm-like infancy. These groups belong apparently to
  much later times.</p>

  <p>On one of the specimens collected by Messrs. Hartt and
  Matthew, and placed by them in my hands, is a spiral form which
  in every particular of external marking resembles a genus of
  modern West Indian Land-snails.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id=
  "FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class=
  "fnanchor">43</a> I have hesitated to describe it, as the
  structure is lost and the form imperfect; but I cannot help
  regarding it as an indication that this group of land animals
  also will be traced back to the Devonian age.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

  <p>Ascending from the Devonian to the Carboniferous, we at once
  find ourselves in the midst of air-breathers of various types.
  Here are Myriapods, insects of several orders, Spiders,
  Scorpions, Land-snails, and Batrachian reptiles, and these of
  many species, and found in many localities widely separated. We
  can thus people those dark, luxuriant forests, to which we owe
  our most valuable beds of coal, with many forms of life; and as
  most of these belong to tribes likely to multiply abundantly
  where food was plentiful, we can imagine multitudes of Snails and
  Millepedes feeding on succulent or decaying vegetable matter,
  swarms of insects flitting through the air in the sunnier spots,
  while their larv&aelig; luxuriated in decaying masses of leaves
  or wood, or peopled the pools and streams. In like manner, in
  imagination we can render these old woods vocal with the trill of
  crickets and with the piping or booming of smaller and larger
  Batrachians. Let us now, in accordance with our plan, inquire as
  to the nature of these early air-breathers and the fortunes of
  their families in the geological history.</p>

  <p>The Land-snails known as yet in the Carboniferous are limited
  to five or six species, belonging to four genera, all American
  and related to existing American forms. The two earliest known
  are represented in <a href="#f124">Figs.&nbsp;124 and 125</a>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id=
  "FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class=
  "fnanchor">44</a> One of them is a <i>Pupa</i>, or elongated
  Land-snail, so similar to modern forms that it does not merit a
  generic distinction, and is indeed very near to some existing
  West Indian species. The other is in like manner a member of the
  modern genus <i>Zonites</i>. These are from the Coal-formation of
  Nova Scotia, and the Pupa must have been very abundant, as it has
  been found in considerable numbers in a layer of shale, and in
  the stumps of erect trees, in beds separated from each other by a
  thickness of 2,000 feet of strata. The <i>Zonites</i> is much more rare.
  A second Pupa is found in Nova Scotia, and two species occur in
  the Coal-field of Illinois. One of these is a Pupa still smaller
  than <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id=
  "Page_143">143</a></span><i>P. vetusta</i>, and, like some modern
  species, with a tooth-like process on the inner lip. The other
  has been placed in a new genus,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
  "FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class=
  "fnanchor">45</a> but is very near to some of the smaller
  American Snails still living. Its most special character is a
  plate extending from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
  "Page_144">144</a></span>the inner lip over half the aperture, a
  contrivance for protection still seen in some modern forms. Thus
  the Land-snails come on the stage in at least three generic
  forms, similar to those which still live, but all of small size,
  indicating perhaps that the conditions were less favourable for
  such creatures than those of the temperate and warmer climates at
  present. It may seem a small step in advance for Sea-snails to
  lose their gills and to become Land-snails, and this without any
  elevation of their general structure; but it must be borne in
  mind that we have here not only the dropping of the gills for an
  air-sac, but profound changes in teeth, mucous glands, shell, and
  other particulars, to fit them for new food and new habits. It is
  also singular that the Land-snails at once appear instead of the
  intermediate forms of the air-breathing fresh-water snails. These
  last may, however, yet be found.</p>

  <p>The Millepedes, like the Land-snails, were first found in the
  Coal-formation of Nova Scotia, but species have since been
  discovered not only in Illinois, but also in Great Britain and in
  Bohemia. In Nova Scotia alone two genera and five distinct
  species have been found, all in the interior of erect trees, to
  which these creatures probably resorted for food and shelter
  (<a href="#f126">Fig.&nbsp;126</a>). All the species yet known are allied to the
  modern Gallyworms, though presenting special features which seem
  to separate them as a distinct family,<a name="FNanchor_46_46"
  id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class=
  "fnanchor">46</a> and were probably vegetable-feeders. Some of
  the species have the peculiarity, unknown among their modern
  successors, of being armed with long spines.<a name=
  "FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The moist, equable
  climate and exuberant vegetation of the Coal-period would
  naturally be very favourable to Millepedes, and it is likely that
  the discoveries made as yet give but a faint idea of their actual
  abundance. It is not improbable that they subsequently declined,
  as we know of none between the Carboniferous and the Jurassic,
  and they do not seem to have improved up to the modern period.
  The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id=
  "Page_145">145</a></span>Carnivorous Myriapods, however, or
  Centipedes proper, a higher and essentially distinct type, are

  <p>The insects of the Carboniferous as yet known, belong to three
  out of the ten or more orders into which the class is divided.
  One of these is represented by a number of species of Cockroach,
  another by May-flies and a Dragon-fly, and another by some
  weevil-like Beetles. The Cockroach is characterised by Huxley as
  one of the &ldquo;oldest, least modified, and in many ways most
  instructive forms of insects;&rdquo; and both he and Rolleston
  take its anatomy as typical of that of the class. That these
  creatures should have abounded in the Coal-period we need not
  wonder, when we consider the habits of those that infest our
  houses, and when we further bear in mind the number of species,
  some of them two inches in length, that exist in tropical
  climates. So many species of this family have been found in the
  Coal-formation on both sides of the Atlantic,<a name=
  "FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that we may fairly
  regard them as constituting one of its most characteristic
  features, and as probably <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>the oldest representatives
  of the order to which they belong<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id=
  "FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class=
  "fnanchor">49</a> (<a href="#f127">Fig.&nbsp;127</a>). There were also in the
  Coal-period insects allied to the Locusts and to the Mantids, a
  carnivorous group. One of the latter (<i>Lithomantis</i>),
  described by Woodward, is a magnificent insect, not unlike some
  modern tropical species. It was found in the Coal-formation of
  Scotland. A still larger species, probably the largest insect
  known, has been described by Brongniart. The May-flies
  (<i>Ephemerid&aelig;</i>) are represented in the Carboniferous by
  several very large species. That of which the wing is shown in
  <a href="#f128">Fig.&nbsp;128</a> must have been seven inches in expanse of wings.
  The habits of the modern May-flies show us how animals of this
  group, living as larv&aelig; in the streams and lakes, must have
  afforded large supplies of food to fishes, and when mature must
  have emerged from the waters in countless myriads, filling the
  air for the brief term of their existence in the perfect state.
  The May-flies represent another insect order.<a name=
  "FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The Coal-measures of
  Saarbruck have afforded several species allied to the white ants
  (<i>Termites</i>), insects which must have found abundant scope
  for their activity in the dead trees <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> of the
  carboniferous forests. The occurrence of beetles,<a name=
  "FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> especially of the
  weevil family, which have as yet been found only in Europe, might
  have been expected, considering the habits and modern
  distribution of this group. It has been asserted that
  moths<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> have been found in the
  Carboniferous; but the proof of this, so far as known to me, is
  the occurrence of leaves, noticed by Sternberg, with markings
  similar to those made by the larv&aelig; of minute leaf-mining
  moths. This, however, is uncertain evidence. If we consider the
  orders of insects not found in the Coal-formation, we can
  perceive good reasons for the absence of some of them. Those
  containing the lice and fleas, and other minute and parasitic
  insects, we can scarcely expect to find. The bees and wasps, and
  the butterflies and moths, are little likely to have been present
  where there were scarcely any flowering plants; but such groups
  as those of the two-winged flies, the plant-bugs and the ants, we
  might have expected, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148"
  id="Page_148">148</a></span>for the fact of their being highly
  specialised forms, and for that reason likely to have appeared
  later.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> There are, indeed, as
  yet no haustellate or suctorial insects known in this early
  period. Plausible theories of the phylogeny of insects are not
  wanting; but they do not well suit the known facts as to their
  first appearance; and perhaps we may venture without much blame
  to apply to the insects of the Coal-period the remark made by
  Wollaston with reference to the rich insect fauna of the isolated
  rock of St. Helena: &ldquo;To a mind which, like my own, can
  accept the doctrine of creative acts as not necessarily
  &lsquo;unphilosophical,&rsquo; the mysteries [of the existence of
  these species in an island so remote from other lands], however
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id=
  "Page_149">149</a></span> great, become at least conceivable; but
  those which are not able to do this may, perhaps, succeed in
  elaborating some special theory of their own, which, even if it
  does not satisfy all the requirements of the problem, may at
  least prove convincing to themselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The suctorial insects make their first certain appearance in
  the Jurassic; and the magnificent Sphinx Moth in <a href="#f129">Fig.&nbsp;129</a> is
  an example of the magnitude and perfection to which that tribe
  attained in the age of the Solenhofen slate; though Weyenburgh,
  who describes it, fancies that he sees evidence that it may,
  unlike any modern moths, have been provided with a sting. The
  most perfect and beautiful fossil butterfly known to me is that
  represented in <a href="#f130">Fig.&nbsp;130</a>, from a photograph kindly given to
  me by Mr. Scudder. It is from the Tertiary rocks of Western
  America, and is laid out in stone as neatly as if prepared by an
  entomologist, while its preservation is so perfect that even the
  microscopic scales on the wings can be made out. It belongs to
  one of the highest types of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span> modern butterflies, that
  to which the <i>Vaness&aelig;</i> belong, but with some points of
  structure pointing to the lower group of the
  &ldquo;Skippers&rdquo; (<i>Hesperiad&aelig;</i>). Scudder remarks
  that while the fore-wings resemble those of the former group, the
  hind-wings look more like those of the latter; and this seems to
  be a common character of two or three others of the few fossil
  species known, none of which are older than the Tertiary.</p>

  <p>We know too little of the spiders and scorpions of the
  Carboniferous to say more than that they closely resemble modern
  forms. Two of the scorpions are represented in <a href="#f131">Figs.&nbsp;131 and 132</a>;
  and the only spider certainly known, which is from Silesia, is
  said to belong to the group of the hunting or trap-door spiders

  <p>The Batrachians of the Coal are its most characteristic and
  remarkable air-breathers,&mdash;especially so as the precursors
  of the reptiles of the Mesozoic age. Cope in a recent summary
  enumerates no less than thirty-nine genera and about one hundred
  species; and to these have to be added at least a dozen more
  recently discovered in Europe; though it was only in 1841 that
  the first indications of such creatures were found, and were then
  regarded by geologists with the same scepticism which some of
  them still apply to <i>Eozoon</i>. The <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>first trace ever observed
  of batrachians in the Carboniferous consisted of a series of
  small but well-marked footprints found by the late Sir W. E.
  Logan in the Lower Carboniferous shales of Horton Bluff, in Nova
  Scotia. In that year this painstaking geologist had examined the
  coal-fields of Pennsylvania and Nova Scotia, with the view of
  following up his important discovery of the
  <i>Stigmari&aelig;</i>, or roots of <i>Sigillaria</i>, as
  accompaniments of the coal-underclays. On his return he read a
  paper, detailing his observations, before the Geological Society
  of London. In this he mentioned the footprints in question; but
  the paper was published only in abstract, and the importance of
  the discovery was overlooked for a time, the anatomists evidently
  being shy to acknowledge the validity of the evidence for a fact
  so unexpected. <a href="#f133">Fig.&nbsp;133</a> is a representation of another slab
  subsequently found in beds of the same age in Nova Scotia, and
  which may serve to indicate the nature of Sir William&rsquo;s
  discovery. In consequence of the neglect of this first hint by
  the London geologists, the discovery of bones of a batrachian by
  von Dechen at Saarbruck in 1844, and that of footprints by King
  in Pennsylvania in the same year, are usually represented as the
  first facts of this kind. My own earliest discovery of reptilian
  bones in Nova Scotia was made in 1844,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span> though
  not published till some time afterward, and was followed up by
  further collections in company with Sir Charles Lyell in 1851, at
  which time also the earliest land-snail was found, and in the
  following year the first millepede. Since that time the progress
  of discovery has been astonishingly rapid, and has extended over
  most of the principal coal-areas on both sides of the
  Atlantic.</p>

  <p>We may, for convenience, call these animals reptiles, but they
  are regarded as belonging to that lower grade of reptilian
  animals, the Amphibians or Batrachians, which includes the modern
  frogs and newts and water-lizards.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id=
  "FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class=
  "fnanchor">56</a> Still it would be doing great injustice to the
  carboniferous reptiles not to say, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>that while related to this
  low type, they presented a much greater range of organisation
  than it shows at present, evincing a capability to fill most of
  the places now occupied by the true reptiles. Some of them were
  aquatic, and with limbs rudimentary or little developed, but many
  of them walked on the land, and were powerful and predaceous
  creatures. They had large and complex teeth, they were protected
  by external bony plates, and some of them had in addition a
  beautiful covering of horny plates and spines, and ornamental
  lappets. Many had well-developed ribs, indicating a condition of
  respiration much in advance of that in the ribless batrachians.
  Some of them attained to size and strength rivalling those of the
  modern alligators, while some of the smallest species exhibit
  characters approaching in some respects to the lizards.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most fish-like of these animals are those first
  discovered by von Dechen (<i>Archegosaurus</i>, <a href="#f134">Fig.&nbsp;134</a>).
  Their long heads, short necks, supports for gills, feeble limbs
  and long flat tail, show that they were aquatic creatures
  presenting many points of resemblance to the Ganoid fishes which
  must have been their companions. Yet they show what no fish can
  exhibit, fore and hind limbs with proper toes, and the complete
  series of bones that appear in our own arms and legs, while they
  must have had true lungs and breathed through nostrils. So
  different are they from the fish in details, that a single limb
  bone, a vertebra, a rib, or a fragment of a skull bone, suffices
  to distinguish them. Much has been said recently of the genesis
  of limbs; and here, as far as now known, we have the first true
  limbs; but it is scarcely too much to say that the feet of
  <i>Archegosaurus</i> differ more from the fins of any
  carboniferous fish than they do from the human hand; while it is
  certain that the feet which made the impressions represented in
  <a href="#f133">Fig.&nbsp;133</a>, on the lowest beds of the Carboniferous, or that
  from the upper coal-formation represented in <a href="#f139">Fig.&nbsp;139</a>, were
  not less typical or perfectly formed feet than those of modern
  lizards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id=
  "Page_154">154</a></span></p>

  <p>Leaving these fish-like forms, we find the remainder of the
  carboniferous reptiles to diverge from them along three
  lines.</p>

  form, could walk well, as is seen from the footprints of some of
  the species which present a considerable stride, and moved over
  mud without the belly touching the ground. Their tails were long,
  and probably useful in swimming. Their heads were flat and
  massive, and their teeth were strengthened by a remarkable
  folding inward of the outer plate of enamel (<a href="#f137">Fig.&nbsp;137</a>

  earlier Mesozoic some of the largest and most typical<span class=

  "fnanchor">61</a> But here their reign ceases, and they give
  place to reptiles of more elevated type, whose history we must
  consider in the next chapter.</p>

  <p>Nothing can be more remarkable than the apparently sudden and
  simultaneous incoming of the batrachian reptiles in the
  Coal-formation. As if at a given signal, they came up like the
  frogs of Egypt everywhere and in all varieties of form. If, as
  evolutionists suppose, they were developed from fishes, this must
  have been by some sudden change, occurring at once all over the
  world, unless indeed some great and unknown gap separates the
  Devonian from the Carboniferous&mdash;a supposition which seems
  quite contrary to fact&mdash;or unless in some region yet
  unexplored this change was proceeding, and at a particular time
  its products spread themselves over the world&mdash;a supposition
  equally improbable. In short, the hypothesis of evolution, as
  applied to these animals, is surrounded with geological
  improbabilities.</p>

  <p>A remarkable picture of the conditions of Pal&aelig;ozoic land
  life is presented by the occurrence of remains of reptiles,
  millepedes and land-snails in such erect trees as that
  represented in <a href="#f140">Fig.&nbsp;140</a>. In the now celebrated section of
  the South Joggins in Nova Scotia, trees of this kind occur at
  more than sixty different levels; but only in one of these have
  they as yet been found to be rich in animal remains. Fortunately
  this bed is so well exposed and so abundant in trees, that I have
  myself, within a few years, removed from it about twenty of them,
  the greater number affording remains of land animals.</p>

  <p>The history of one of these trees may be shortly stated thus.
  It was a <i>Sigillaria</i>, perhaps two feet in diameter, and its
  stem had a dense and imperishable outer bark, a soft cellular
  inner bark liable to rapid decay, and a slender woody axis not
  very durable. It grew on the surface of a swamp, now represented
  by a bed of coal. By inundations and by subsidence, this
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id=
  "Page_160">160</a></span>swamp was exposed to the invasion of
  muddy and sandy sediment, and this went on accumulating until the
  stem of the tree was buried to the height of about nine feet,
  before which time it was no doubt killed. After a time the top
  decayed and fell, leaving the buried stump imbedded in the sandy
  soil, which had now become dry, or nearly so. The trunk decayed,
  its inner bark and axis rotting away and falling in shreds into
  the bottom of the cylindrical hole, about nine feet deep, once
  occupied by the stem, and now kept open like a shaft or well by
  the hard resisting outer bank. The ground around this opening
  became clothed with ferns and reed-like <i>Calamites</i>, partly masking
  and concealing it. And now millepedes and land snails made the
  buried trunk a home, or fell into it in their wanderings; and
  small reptiles sporting around, in pursuit of prey, or themselves
  pursued, stumbled into the open pitfall, and were unable to
  extricate themselves, though I have found in some of the layers
  in these trees trails which show that these<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
  imprisoned reptiles had wearily wandered round and round, in the
  vain search for means of exit, till they died of exhaustion and
  famine. The bones of these dead reptiles, shells of land-snails
  and crusts of millepedes, accumulated in these natural coffins,
  and became mixed with vegetable debris falling into them, and
  with thin layers of mud washed in by the rains; and this process
  continued so long that a layer of six inches to a foot in
  thickness, full of bones, was sometimes produced. At length a new
  change supervened, the area was again inundated and drifted over
  with sand, and the hollow trunk was filled to the top and buried
  under many feet of sediment, never to be re-opened till, after
  the whole had been hardened into sandstone and elevated to form a
  part of the modern coast, when the old tree and its forest
  companions which had shared the same fate with it, are made to
  yield up their treasures to the geologist. This history is no
  fancy picture. It represents the results of long and careful
  study of the beds holding these erect trees, and of the laborious
  extraction of great numbers of them, and the breaking-up of their
  contents into thin flakes, to be carefully examined with the lens
  under a bright light in search of the relics they contained.
  <a href="#f11">Fig.&nbsp;11</a> in Chap. I. represents the extraction of one of
  these trees, which happened to be partially exposed by the
  wasting of the cliff; but many others had to be laboriously mined
  out of the rock by blasting with gunpowder.</p>

  <p>It is evident that the combination of circumstances referred
  to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id=
  "Page_162">162</a></span> above could not often occur; and it is
  therefore not wonderful that only in one place and one bed has
  evidence of it been found, and that even in this some of the
  trees have been filled up at once by sand and clay, or so crushed
  by falling in or lateral pressure, that they could receive no
  animal remains. In one respect this is a striking evidence of the
  imperfection of the geological record, since, but for what may be
  called a fortunate accident, many of the most interesting
  inhabitants of the coal forests might have been altogether
  unknown to us. On the other hand, it shows how strange and
  unexpected are the ways in which the relics of the old world have
  been preserved for our inspection, and that there is probably
  scarcely any animal or plant that has ever lived of which some
  fragment does not exist, did we know where to look for it.</p>

  <p>It may be well to remark, in closing this chapter, how many
  new forms of life, air-breathing and otherwise, make their first
  appearance in the Carboniferous, and have continued to prevail
  until now. Here we find the first specimens of Amphibians,
  Spiders, Myriapods, Orthopterous and Coleopterous Insects, and of
  the Crabs among ten-footed Crustaceans. In the latter group
  Woodward has recently described the oldest known crab, from the
  Coal-formation of Belgium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

  period, we might have supposed that the line of the great
  Labyrinthodont Batrachians would have been continued onward and
  elevated, perhaps, in the direction of the Mammalia, to which
  some features of their structure point. But we should have been
  mistaken in this. The Labyrinthodonts, it is true, extend into
  the Trias; but there is perhaps a sign of their coming
  degradation in the appearance in the Permian of the first known
  mud-eel, a humble Batrachian form allied to the Newts and
  Water-lizards.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id=
  "FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class=
  "fnanchor">62</a> Their special peculiarities are dropped in the
  Mesozoic in favour of those of certain small and feeble
  lizard-like animals, appearing first in the Carboniferous, and
  more manifestly in the Permian, and which are the true
  forerunners, though they can scarcely be the ancestors, of the
  magnificent reptilian species of the Mesozoic, which have caused
  this period to be called &ldquo;the age of reptiles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The leading reptilian animal from the European Permian has
  long been the <i>Proterosaurus</i>, from the copper slates of
  Thuringia (<a href="#f141">Fig.&nbsp;141</a>), a reptile of lizard-like form, with
  well-developed limbs, and attaining a length of three or four
  feet. It resembles more nearly those large modern lizards known
  as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id=
  "Page_166">166</a></span> &ldquo;Monitors,&rdquo; than any other
  existing form. The fore-limb represented in the figure
  foreshadows very closely the bones of the human arm and hand.
  Besides this we find in the Permian certain lizards
  (<i>Theriodonts</i> of Owen) which present the remarkable and
  advanced peculiarity already predicted by some Carboniferous
  Microsauria,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id=
  "FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class=
  "fnanchor">63</a> of having distinct canine teeth, producing a
  division into incisors, canines, and molars, in the manner of the
  Carnivorous quadrupeds, which they seem also to have resembled in
  some other parts of their skeletons. It is not impossible that
  the footprints in the Permian sandstones of Scotland, which have
  been referred to tortoises, were those of animals of this type.
  Cope has recently described from the Permian of Texas a number of
  reptiles which have the complex dentition of the Theriodonts, and
  others which simulate that of Herbivorous mammals, by the
  possession of flat grinding teeth supposed to be adapted to
  vegetable food.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
  "FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class=
  "fnanchor">64</a> The teeth of all these Permian reptiles were
  set in sockets, also an advanced peculiarity. Thus already in the
  Permian, before the final decadence of the Carboniferous flora,
  and while the Pal&aelig;ozoic invertebrates still lingered in the sea,
  the age of reptiles dawned, and gave promise of its future
  greatness by the assumption on the part of reptilian species of
  structures now limited to the Mammalia.</p>

  <p>But the great Mesozoic reptiles were not fully enthroned, till
  the Permian, an unsettled and disturbed age, characterised by
  great earth movements, had passed away, and until that period of
  continental elevation, with local deserts and desiccation, and
  much volcanic action, which we call the Trias, had also
  passed.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

  <p>Then in the Jurassic and early Cretaceous the reptiles
  culminated, and presented features of magnitude and structural
  complexity unrivalled in later times. At the same time the
  Labyrinthodonts disappear, or are degraded into the humble
  stations which the modern Batrachians now occupy.</p>

  <p>To understand the reptiles of this age, it will be necessary
  to notice the subdivisions of their modern representatives. The
  true reptiles now existing constitute the following
  orders:&mdash;1, the Turtles and Tortoises (<i>Chelonia</i>); 2,
  the Snakes (<i>Ophidia</i>); 3, the Lizards (<i>Lacertilia</i>);
  4, the Crocodiles and Alligators (<i>Crocodilia</i>). All of
  these, except the snakes, are well represented among Mesozoic
  fossils; but we have in this middle age of the earth&rsquo;s
  geological history to add to them from five to seven orders now
  altogether extinct, and these not of low and inferior
  organisation, but including species far in advance of any now
  existing both in elevation and magnitude, and constituting the
  veritable aristocracy of the reptile race. It will best serve our
  purpose here to consider chiefly these perished orders and their
  history, and then to notice very shortly those that now
  survive.</p>

  <p>The first of the extinct orders is that of the great
  Sea-lizards,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id=

  "fnanchor">65</a> of which the now familiar <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>
  and <i>Plesiosaurus</i> of the English seas, to be seen in all
  museums and text-books, are the types (<a href="#f142">Figs.&nbsp;142, 142<i>a</i></a> and
  142<i>b</i>). These were marine animals of large size, but not
  fishes or amphibians. They were true air-breathing reptiles, but
  with paddles for swimming instead of feet, and some of them with
  long flattened tails for steering and propulsion. They bore, in
  short, precisely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id=
  "Page_168">168</a></span>the same relation to the other members
  of the class Reptilia which the Whales and Porpoises bear to the
  ordinary quadrupeds. Some of these animals are believed to have
  been fifty or sixty feet in length, thus rivalling the Whales,
  while others were of smaller dimensions, like the Porpoises and
  Dolphins. Some, like the <i>Ichthyosaurus</i> and
  <i>Pliosaurus</i> (<a href="#f142">Fig.&nbsp;142</a><i>a</i>), were strongly built
  and powerful swimmers, and able to destroy the largest fishes,
  while others, like <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, had the body short and
  compact, the head small, and the neck long and flexible, and
  probably preyed on small animals near the borders of the waters.
  Catalogues of British fossils alone include about thirty species
  of Enaliosaurs, which haunted the coasts of Mesozoic Europe, a
  wonderful fact, when we consider the absence of these creatures
  from the modern seas, and the probability that only a fraction of
  the species are yet known to us.</p>

  which Cope has given the name of <i>Pythonomorpha</i>, and which
  he regards as allied to the serpents, or as gigantic sea-serpents
  provided with swimming paddles, but which Owen considers more
  nearly connected with the lizards. In either case they constitute
  a group by themselves, remarkable not only on account of their
  anatomical affinities with animals so unlike them in general
  port, but also for their enormously extended length and
  formidable dentition (<a href="#f143">Fig.&nbsp;143</a>). Such animals as the
  <i>Mososaurus</i> of Maestricht and <i>Clidastes</i> of Western
  America may have exceeded in length the largest Ichthyosaurs and
  the most bulky of living Cetaceans, though their slender forms
  and numerous vertebr&aelig; remind one of the semi-fabulous
  sea-serpent, rather than of any known animal of our modern age.
  They were characteristic of the Later Mesozoic, more especially
  of the Cretaceous period, and must have been formidable enemies
  to the fishes of their time.</p>

  <p>Owen has formed two orders<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id=
  "FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class=
  "fnanchor">66</a> for the reception of some remarkable extinct
  reptiles of this age, found especially in South Africa and India,
  but also in Europe and America. The first includes large
  lizard-like animals having horny jaws like those of turtles, and
  in some of the species with great defensive tusks
  (<a href="#f144">Fig.&nbsp;144</a>). Their mode of life is not well known, but they
  may have been peaceable and harmless vegetable feeders. The
  second has been already referred to, in connection with the
  Permian, where it first appears, though it is continued in the
  Trias (<a href="#f145">Fig.&nbsp;145</a>). The resemblance of the skulls of these
  creatures to those of Carnivorous mammals is very striking, and
  nothing can be more singular than their early appearance and
  their decadence before the advent of those Tertiary mammals which
  in more modern times occupy their place.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most extraordinary of all the Mesozoic
  modifications of the reptilian type was that of the flying
  reptiles, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id=
  "Page_170">170<br />
  171</a></span> <i>Pterodactyls</i>. These were, in short, lizards
  modified for flight, somewhat in the same manner with the bats
  among the mammals. If the bat may be likened to a flying
  shrew-mouse, a Pterodactyl may in like manner be compared to a
  flying lizard; but the modification in the latter case is by much
  the more remarkable, inasmuch as the lizard is a cold-blooded
  animal, and far less likely to be endowed with the active
  circulation and muscular power necessary to flight than is the
  mouse. In point of fact, there can be no doubt that the
  Pterodactyls must have been provided with some approach to a
  mammalian or ornithic heart, as they certainly were with great
  breast-muscles attached to a keel in the breast-bone for working
  their large membranous wings. These wings were also somewhat
  original in their construction. They were not furnished with
  pinions, like those of the bird, but with a membrane like that of
  the bat, and this, instead of being stretched over four
  enormously lengthened fingers, as in that quadruped, was
  supported on a single elongated finger, corresponding, singularly
  enough, to the little finger, which usually inconspicuous member
  constituted in some of these strange creatures a limb longer than
  the whole body (<a href="#f146">Figs.&nbsp;146, 147</a>.) The other fingers of the hand
  were left free for walking or grasping. They are thus believed to
  have been able to walk as well as to fly, and even in case
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=
  "Page_172">172</a></span> need, to swim; while they could
  probably perch like birds on rocks and trees. Their heads, though
  very lightly framed, were large and reptilian in aspect, and
  furnished with sharp teeth, and sometimes probably with a beak as
  well. Few creatures of the old world are of more hideous and
  sinister aspect. Yet some of them must have been as light and
  graceful on the wing as swallows or sea-gulls. There are many
  species, most of them small, but some of those in the later
  Mesozoic attained to so great a size that the expanse of their
  wings must have exceeded twenty feet, making them veritable
  flying dragons, probably formidable to all the smaller animals of
  their time. Though these animals were strictly reptiles, they
  combined in their structures contrivances for a&euml;rial
  locomotion now distributed between the bats and the birds. They
  had bat-like wings and bird-like chests. Some had horny beaks.
  All had hollow limb bones, and air cavities to give lightness to
  the skull. Their brains approach to those of birds, and, as
  already stated, their respiration and circulation must have been
  of a high order. These facts are very suggestive, and perhaps in
  no point is the imagination or the faith of the devout
  evolutionist more severely<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span> tested than in realising
  the spontaneous assumption of these characters by reptiles, and
  their subsequent distribution between the very dissimilar types
  in which they are now continued.</p>

  <p>The approximation of the winged reptiles to the birds is
  further increased by the facts that in the Jurassic and
  Cretaceous periods there were birds having reptilian tails and
  probably toothed jaws (<i>Arch&aelig;opteryx macroura</i>,
  <a href="#f148">Fig.&nbsp;148</a>). The species just named, while in its limbs,
  trunk, and feathers a veritable perching bird, resembles a
  reptile in its head and tail. In the Cretaceous of Western
  America, Marsh has recently discovered two distinct types of
  toothed birds, one having the teeth in regular sockets, the other
  having them implanted in a groove in the jaw. One of these birds
  (<i>Ichthyornis dispar</i>, <a href="#f149">Fig.&nbsp;149</a>) was larger than a
  pigeon, with powerful wings constructed like those of ordinary
  birds. It had also the curious and old-fashioned peculiarity of
  biconcave vertebr&aelig;, like those of fishes and some reptiles.
  Another (<i>Hesperornis regalis</i>) stood five or six feet high,
  and had rudimentary wings like those of the Penguins. These
  toothed birds extend into the Eocene Tertiary, where the
  <i>Odontopteryx</i> of Owen has been known for some time. In the
  Eocene, however, this toothed bird is associated with others of
  ordinary types, allied closely to the Ostriches, the Pelicans,
  the Ibis, the Woodpeckers, the Hawks, the Owls, the Vultures, and
  the ordinary perching birds. In the Later Mesozoic, indeed, some
  reptiles became so bird-like that they nearly approached the
  earliest birds; but this was a final and futile effort of the
  reptile to obtain in the air that supremacy which it had
  long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id=
  "Page_174">174</a></span> enjoyed in earth and water; and its
  failure was immediately succeeded in the Eocene by the appearance
  of a cloud of true birds, representing all the existing orders of
  the class.</p>

  <p>We may close our notice of the winged reptiles of the Mesozoic
  by quoting from Phillips his summary of the characters of
  <i>Rhamphorhyncus</i> (<a href="#f147">Fig.&nbsp;147</a>)<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id=
  "FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class=
  "fnanchor">67</a>: &ldquo;Gifted with ample means of flight, able
  at least to perch on rocks and scuffle along the shore, perhaps
  competent to dive, though not so well as a palmiped bird, many
  fishes must have yielded to the cruel beak and sharp teeth of the
  <i>Rhamphorhyncus</i>. If we ask to which of the many families of birds
  the analogy of structure and probable way of life would lead us
  to assimilate Rhamphorhyncus, the answer must point to the
  swimming races, with long wings, clawed feet, hooked beak, and
  habits of violence and voracity; and for preference, the
  shortness of the legs and other circumstances may be held to
  claim for the Stonesfield fossil a more than fanciful similitude
  to the groups of Cormorants and other marine divers which
  constitute an effective part of the picturesque army of robbers
  of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lastly, the reptiles, in this age of their imperial sway,
  culminated in the <i>Dinosaurians</i>, animals far above any
  modern Reptilia in the perfection of their organisation, and many
  of them of gigantic size. Just as the Pterosaurs filled the place
  now occupied by the birds, so the Dinosaurs filled that
  represented by the mammals, or rather they took up a place
  holding some close relations with both the birds and the mammals.
  There were thus reptilian animals which on the one hand were the
  elephants and lions of their time, and on the other bore a
  grotesque resemblance to creatures so unlike these as the
  Ostriches, in so far as their anatomical structure was concerned;
  while it is evident that their whole organisation places them in
  the highest position possible within the reptilian class.
  Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id=
  "Page_176">176</a></span> of them must have been herbivorous, and
  probably slow in movement and quiet in nature. Others were
  carnivorous and of terrible energy, while furnished with the most
  destructive weapons (<a href="#f152">Figs.&nbsp;152, 153</a>). Many had the power of
  erecting themselves on their hind-feet and walking as bipeds; and
  to adapt them to this end their hinder limbs were very large and
  strong, and they had long pillar-like tails, while their
  fore-feet were comparatively small, and used perhaps mainly for
  prehension (<a href="#f151">Figs.&nbsp;151, 154</a>).</p>

  size.</p>

  <p>The size of some of these creatures was stupendous. The
  <i>Hadrosaurus</i> of New Jersey, an Herbivorous species
  (<a href="#f151">Fig.&nbsp;151</a>), when erected on its hind limbs and tail, must
  have stood more than twenty feet in height. <i>Megalosaurus</i>
  and <i>Iguanodon</i>, of the English Jurassic and Wealden, must
  have been of still more gigantic size. The former was a
  carnivorous animal, its head (<a href="#f152">Fig.&nbsp;152</a>) four or five feet in
  length, armed with teeth, sabre-shaped, sharp and crenate on the
  edges (<a href="#f153">Fig.&nbsp;153</a>), its hind limbs of enormous power, so that
  if our imagination does not fail us in the attempt to realise
  such a wonder, we may even<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span> suppose this huge animal,
  much larger than the largest elephant, springing like a tiger on
  its prey, a miracle of terrible strength and ferocity, before
  which no living thing could stand. Its companion,
  <i>Iguanodon</i>, was, on the contrary, a harmless herbivorous
  creature, using its great strength and stature as a means of
  obtaining leaves and fruits for food, and perhaps falling a prey
  to the larger Carnivorous Dinosaurs its contemporaries. A still
  more bulky animal was the <i>Ceteosaurus</i>, so admirably
  described by Phillips. Its thigh-bone measures more than five
  feet in length and a foot in diameter; and it must have stood ten
  feet high when on all fours, while its length must have reached
  forty or fifty feet. It seems from the forms of its bones to have
  been able to walk on land, but probably spent most of its time in
  the water, where it may be compared to a huge reptilian
  hippopotamus. Very recently some bones found in rocks, possibly
  of Wealden age, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id=
  "Page_178">178</a></span> Western America, and described by Cope
  and by Marsh, indicate that even <i>Ceteosaurus</i> had not
  attained to the maximum of Dinosaurian dimensions. These new
  animals have vertebr&aelig; twenty inches in length and from
  twelve inches to thirteen inches in the diameter of their bodies,
  while their lateral processes stretched three and a half feet.
  The shoulder-blade of one species is five feet in length, and its
  thigh-bone is six feet long. From these measurements Cope
  concludes that, unlike most other Dinosaurs, it had the fore-feet
  larger in proportion than the hind-feet, so as to have somewhat
  the appearance of a large giraffe. The bones of the back have a
  remarkable cavernous structure, which Cope interprets as
  indicating air cavities, to give lightness, as in the case of the
  bones of birds; but Owen suggests that the cavities were filled
  with cartilage, and that the animals were aquatic in their
  habits. Evidently in point of size the Dinosaurs had a better
  claim than even Behemoth to be called the &ldquo;chief of the
  ways of God.&rdquo; Some of them, however, were of small size,
  and probably active and bird-like in their movements. One of
  these is the animal represented in <a href="#f154">Fig.&nbsp;154</a>, a species from
  the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen.<a name="FNanchor_68_68"

  <p>Nothing in the life of the Mesozoic has so seized on the
  imagination of evolutionists as the links of connection between
  birds and reptiles, which has even been introduced by Huxley into
  the classification of animals, by his grouping these heretofore
  very distinct classes in one gigantic and comprehensive class of
  <i>Sauropsida</i>. It is necessary, therefore, to glance at these
  connections, and if possible to arrive at some conception of
  their true value. The links which connect the reptiles and the
  birds are twofold. First, that between the Dinosaurs and the
  ostrich tribe,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id=
  "FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class=
  "fnanchor">69</a> and, secondly, that between the Pterodactyls
  and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id=
  "Page_179">179</a></span>their allies, and the peculiar Mesozoic
  birds, such as <i>Arch&aelig;opteryx</i>. The first would serve
  to account for the few exceptional Struthious birds of the modern
  world. The second would account for the Passerine and other more
  ordinary birds; and thus, according to evolution, the now
  somewhat homogeneous class of birds would have a double, or more
  probably multiple, origin from several lines of reptilian
  ancestors. This, no doubt, greatly complicates the links of
  connection, whether these be supposed to indicate derivation or
  not.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

  </div>

  <p class="center2"><span class=
  "smcap">Fig.&nbsp;154.</span>&mdash;<i>Compsognathus.</i> One of
  the smaller Dinosaurs.&mdash;After Wagner.</p>

  <p>If we inquire as to the first connection above stated, we may
  define it briefly in the words of Prof. Phillips, with reference
  to <i>Megalosaurus</i>, which &ldquo;was not a ground-crawler,
  like the alligator, but moving with free steps, chiefly, if not
  solely, on the hind limbs, and claiming a curious analogy, if not
  some degree of affinity, with the ostrich.&rdquo;<a name=
  "FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> But the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>question
  arises, Was this resemblance merely that of two oviparous bipeds,
  or anything more? and when we set off, against the resemblance in
  haunch bones and hind limbs, the entire dissimilarity in head, in
  fore limbs, in vertebr&aelig;, in tail, and probably in external
  covering, we are disposed to agree with Huxley in his statement,
  with respect to the Struthious birds, that their &ldquo;total
  amount of approximation to the reptilian type is but small; and
  the gap between reptiles and birds is but very slightly narrowed
  by their existence.&rdquo; There is therefore here a great gap,
  even in the linking together of the types, independently of any
  question of derivation.</p>

  <p>The second line of connection appears at first sight more
  promising. <i>Arch&aelig;opteryx</i> has a reptilian tail, and claws on
  the wing; and, as it had toothed jaws, like some of the birds in
  the Cretaceous, must have altogether made a much nearer approach
  to a reptile than any modern bird does. The remarkable
  &ldquo;fish-bird&rdquo; (<i>Ichthyornis</i>) of Marsh is also
  very reptilian in some of its characters. But when we compare
  these reptilian birds with the Pterodactyls and their allies, a
  vast gap at once becomes apparent. Disregarding the external
  clothing, we find the wing in the two groups entirely dissimilar
  in details of construction, and this dissimilarity extends to the
  hind limbs as well, so that the Pterodactyls resemble bats rather
  than birds.</p>

  <p>Without committing ourselves to any doctrine of development,
  we might have rejoiced if our geological discoveries had
  established a continuous chain, or two continuous chains, of
  being between the reptiles and the birds; but this end is
  evidently still far from being attained, though some
  approximation has undoubtedly been made. To quote again the
  admission of Huxley: &ldquo;Birds are no more modified reptiles
  than reptiles are modified birds, the reptilian and ornithic
  types being both in reality somewhat different superstructures,
  raised upon one and the same ground-plan&rdquo;&mdash;that
  ground-plan being the idea of the air-breathing oviparous
  vertebrate, and the reptile<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span> representing the less
  specialized and less ornate building. As yet the origin of that
  idea, and the mode of carrying it out to completion, remain
  unknown, except to the Architect and Builder, who may reveal them
  to earnest seekers for truth in His own good time.</p>

  <p>As to links of connection with the Mammalia, these are still
  more obscure. In the Mesozoic the mammals are represented as yet
  only by a few small species allied to the pouched (Marsupial) and
  insectivorous quadrupeds of Australia, and these are closely
  linked with some of the smaller carnivorous Mammalia of the early
  Tertiary; but neither approach very closely to any known
  reptilian types. Nor have we yet any connecting links between the
  great marine reptiles and the Cetaceans and Sirenians which in
  the Tertiary take their place in the sea.</p>

  <p>It is an interesting fact, to come before us in our next
  chapter, that the great land reptiles of the Mesozoic survived
  long enough to become contemporary with the introduction and
  first luxuriance of the modern types of vegetation in the later
  Cretaceous. It would be natural to suppose that access to these
  great supplies of better food would have stimulated the increase
  and development of the herbivorous species, and would have
  indirectly had the same effect on those that were carnivorous;
  but the opposite result seems to have followed, and in the next
  period the reptiles altogether gave place to the mammals, unless,
  indeed, they were themselves by some mysterious and comparatively
  rapid process transformed into Mammalia, to suit them to the
  better conditions of an improved world.</p>

  <p>So far as yet known, the reign of reptiles was world-wide in
  its time; and the imagination is taxed to conceive of a state of
  things in which the seas swarmed with great reptiles on every
  coast, when the land was trodden by colossal reptilian bipeds and
  quadrupeds, in comparison with some of which our elephants are
  pygmies, and when the air was filled with the grotesque and
  formidable Pterodactyls. Yet this is no fancy<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
  picture. It represents a time which actually existed, when that
  comparatively low, brutal, and insensate type of existence
  represented by the modern crocodiles and alligators was supreme
  in the world. The duration of these creatures was long, and in
  watching the progress of creation, they would have seemed the
  permanent inhabitants of the earth. Yet all have perished, and
  their modern successors, except a few large species existing in
  the warmer climates, have become subject to the more recently
  introduced Mammalia.</p>

  <p>How did the ancient reptile aristocracy perish? We are
  ignorant of the details of the catastrophe, but their final
  disappearance and replacement by the more modern fauna was
  connected with a great continental subsidence in the Cretaceous
  age, and with changes of climate and conditions preceding and
  subsequent to it. Yet the struggle for continued dominion was
  hard and protracted; and toward its close some of the champions
  of the reign of reptiles were the greatest and most magnificent
  examples of the type; as if they had risen in their might to defy
  approaching ruin. Thus some of the most stupendous forms appear
  in the later Cretaceous, after the great subsidence had made
  progress and almost attained its consummation. Like the
  antediluvian giants, they were undismayed even when the land
  began to sink beneath their feet; and for them there was no ark
  of deliverance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id=

  <h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the first forests of modern
  type.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/fcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "F" /><span class="smcap">or</span> a long time it was believed
  by geologists that a great and mysterious gap separated the Upper
  Cretaceous from the oldest Tertiary formations; and in Western
  Europe, in so far as physical conditions and animal life are
  concerned, the severance seemed nearly complete. Oceanic
  deposits, like the Upper Chalk, are succeeded by beds of littoral
  and estuarine characters. The last and some of the greatest of
  the Mesozoic Saurians have their burial-places in the Upper
  Cretaceous, and appear no more on earth. The wonderful
  shell-fishes of the Ammonite group, and the cuttle-fishes of the
  Belemnite type, share the same fate. With the earliest deposits
  of the Eocene Tertiary came in multitudes of large Mammalia
  heretofore unknown, and the Cetaceans appear in the sea instead
  of the great marine lizards; while shells, corals, and
  crustaceans of modern types swarm in the waters. Thus it is true
  that a great and apparently somewhat abrupt change takes place at
  the close of the Cretaceous, and terminates for ever the
  reptilian age. Even in regions like Western America, where
  physically the later Cretaceous shades gradually into the earlier
  Tertiary, so that there have been doubts as to the limits of
  these several periods, the same great change in animal life
  occurs.</p>

  <p>But a link of connection has at length been found in the
  history of the vegetable kingdom. The modern flora
  came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id=
  "Page_186">186</a></span> in with its full force in the later
  Cretaceous, before the end of the reptilian age, and continued
  onward to the present time. Thus the plant takes precedence of
  the animal, and the preparation was made for the mammalian life
  of the Eocene by the introduction of the modern flora in the
  Cretaceous period. In like manner it is possible that the great
  graphite deposits of the Laurentian indicate a vegetation which
  preceded the swarming marine life of the Cambrian; and it is not
  improbable that the Pal&aelig;ozoic land flora existed long
  before the first land animals. Thus the plant, as in the old
  Mosaic record, ever appears on the day before the animal, in each
  stage of the development of the world.</p>

  <p>In Chapter <span class="smcap">IV.</span> we traced the
  history of the old and rich vegetation of the Coal period. But
  this vegetation consisted principally of cryptogams and those
  lowest ph&aelig;nogams, of the pine and cycad groups, which have
  naked seeds. In the modern flora we may arrange the several
  groups of plants, somewhat naturally, as follows:&mdash;</p>

      <td class="left85"><i>Exogens</i>, oaks, maples, &amp;c.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>With reference to the history of these groups the record
  stands as follows:&mdash;In the Pal&aelig;ozoic age classes 3 and
  4 culminated, and constituted the great mass of the arboreal
  vegetation. On entering the Mesozoic, No. 3<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span> becomes
  somewhat diminished, but No. 4 continues with unabated
  prevalence, so that the Mesozoic has sometimes been characterized
  as emphatically the age of Gymnosperms. With these appear some
  Endogens, allied to the modern Yuccas and Screw pines and Arums.
  But in the lower Mesozoic rocks we have no representatives of the
  broad-leaved Exogens (Angiosperms), which constitute the great
  mass of ordinary forest vegetation; and it is only in the
  Cretaceous that we find them appearing in force, and that the
  monotonous vegetation of the older style was replaced by the more
  beautiful and varied forms of our modern woods.</p>

  <p>In Europe, in the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous of
  Bohemia (<i>Cenomanian</i>), have been found some leaves which
  indicate the beginning of this change. These have been referred
  to C&aelig;salpinias or Brasilettos, pod-bearing trees of India
  and tropical America, Aralias or Ginsengs, Magnolias, Laurels, an
  Ivy, and a peculiar and uncertain genus (<i>Credneria</i>). With
  these are noble palms, both of the types with pinnate and palmate
  leaves, and trees allied to the Giant Sequoias of California, and
  to the Araucarian pines of the southern hemisphere. (See
  Frontispiece to this Chapter.) These ancient Cretaceous forests
  of Eastern Europe are compared by Saporta with those which now
  live in the warmer portions of China or in South
  America&mdash;truly a marvellous change from the sombre and
  uniform vegetation by which they seem to have been immediately
  preceded. A still further development of modern vegetation takes
  place in the next or highest member of the Cretaceous, the
  Maestricht beds (<i>Senonian</i>), where we find a crowd of
  modern types. On this great change Count Saporta remarks with
  truth that there seem to have been periods of pause and of
  activity in the introduction of plants. The Jurassic period was
  one of inactivity; and a new and vigorous evolution, as he
  regards it, is introduced in the middle of the Cretaceous.</p>

  <p>This new and grand elevation of the vegetable kingdom
  in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id=
  "Page_188">188</a></span> the Cretaceous age was not local
  merely. In Moravia, in the Hartz, in Belgium and France, even in
  Greenland, the same great renewing of the face of the earth was
  in progress. In America it was proceeding on a grand scale, and
  seems to have set in earlier than in Europe.<a name=
  "FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> In the Dakota group of
  the West, one of the lower members of the Cretaceous, and
  covering a vast area, a rich angiospermous flora has been
  discovered by Hayden, and described by Lesquereux and Newberry,
  and beds of coal have been formed from its remains. In
  Vancouver&rsquo;s Island in British Columbia, Cretaceous coal
  measures occur, comparable in value and in the excellence of the
  fuel they afford with those of the true coal formation. Some of
  the beds of coal are eight feet in thickness, and the shales
  associated with them abound in leaves of exogenous trees
  generally similar to those still living in America. In these beds
  are also found mineralized trunks, which present under the
  microscope the familiar structures of our oaks, birches, and
  other modern trees. Thus all over the northern hemisphere the
  elevation of the land out of the waters of the great Cretaceous
  subsidence was signalized by a development of noble and exuberant
  forest vegetation, of the types still extant. The following list
  of families found in the Cretaceous, after Saporta, will show the
  botanist how fully our modern Exogens are represented:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Of the plants in this list, some, like the oaks, birches,
  willows, and heaths, are common and familiar members of the flora
  of the northern hemisphere to-day, and even of the European
  flora. Some, like the Magnolias, Myricas, and witch-hazels, are
  characteristically American, and a few, like the Proteace&aelig;,
  are now confined to the southern hemisphere. Some of these
  families have dwindled since the Cretaceous time, so as to be
  represented by very few species, or at least have not advanced,
  while others have multiplied and prospered; and on the whole the
  flora of the northern hemisphere seems to have been as rich in
  this early beginning of our modern forests as it is at the
  present day. Lesquereux&rsquo;s results, with reference to the
  American flora of the Dakota group, are very similar, and present
  some surprising features of resemblance to modern American
  forests, though he remarks that these Cretaceous trees are
  generally characterized by the even or unserrated edges of their
  leaves; and the same remark seems to apply to the oldest
  Cretaceous leaves of Europe.</p>

  <p>A very singular feature of the Cretaceous flora is the number
  of species of some genera now represented by few or even a single
  species; and this is the more remarkable when we consider how few
  species, comparatively, of the older flora, are known to us. For
  example, Lesquereux, though aware of the great variability of the
  modern Sassafras of America, recognizes eight species of this
  genus in the Dakota Cretaceous, one of which seems to be that
  still living in America, so that it has continued unchanged,
  while the others have perished (<a href="#f155">Fig.&nbsp;155</a>). Thus this genus
  culminates at once in the Cretaceous, but continues still in one
  of its species. Again, the tulip-tree, <i>Liriodendron</i>, one
  of the most beautiful, unique, and invariable of American trees,
  is represented by one sole species in the present world. There
  seem to be no less than four in the Dakota beds, besides others
  in the Cretaceous of New Jersey, and one species is found in the
  Tertiary of Greenland as well as in that of Europe
  (<a href="#f156">Fig.&nbsp;156</a>). There are<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span> probably four or five
  species of plane-tree (<i>Platanus</i>) now extant, of which but
  one occurs in America, unless <i>P. Mexicana</i>, the Mexican
  plane-tree, is a good species as distinct from the ordinary, more
  northern, form. There are seven species, according to Lesquereux,
  in the Cretaceous of Dakota alone. This sort of evolution
  backward, or from many species to few, would probably be greatly
  increased, had we fuller knowledge of the Cretaceous flora, as
  there are several genera already represented by as many species
  as they can boast in modern times. We have already seen that this
  abrupt and sudden culmination of genera and families, and their
  subsequent decadence, is no rare thing in geology, and it
  connects itself with that idea of periods of creative activity
  which we have already had occasion to notice.<span class=

  <p>I have dwelt principally on the ph&aelig;nogamous plants of
  the Cretaceous, as presenting the most noteworthy and new
  features of the time; but we must not forget that though
  cryptogams were deposed from the high position they held in the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic, they still existed; and there are more
  especially many interesting species of ferns and equisetums in
  the Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. These are, however, of
  modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id=
  "Page_192">192</a></span> types; and it is remarkable that some
  of them appear to have continued without even specific change
  from the later Cretaceous up to the present time. A striking
  illustration of this is afforded by two ferns discovered side by
  side in the oldest Eocene beds<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id=
  "FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class=
  "fnanchor">72</a> of the plains west of Red River, and described
  in Dr. G. M. Dawson&rsquo;s report on the 49th parallel. One of
  these is the well-known and very common <i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>
  (<a href="#f157">Fig.&nbsp;157</a>), or sensitive fern of Eastern America.<a name=
  "FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> This species came into
  existence at latest at the close of the Cretaceous, and has
  apparently been continued in America up to the present time. In
  Europe, where it does not now live, it occurs as a fossil in
  Eocene beds in the Isle of Mull. The other is <i>Davallia
  tenuifolia</i> (<a href="#f158">Fig.&nbsp;158</a>), a delicate little plant belonging
  to a genus not now represented in America, and to a species at
  present found only in Asia. Yet this species also <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>lived in
  America in early Eocene times, but has since been banished,
  though its former companion, the <i>Onoclea</i>, still holds its
  ground. Such cases of specific persistence along with great
  changes of habitat are very instructive as to the permanence of
  species.</p>

  <p>Count Saporta, whose just remarks on the marvellously sudden
  incoming of the Cretaceous flora we have already referred to,
  also notices the fact that the families and genera represented in
  this flora are a most miscellaneous and unconnected assemblage,
  showing either the simultaneous appearance of many dissimilar
  types, or requiring us to believe in the existence of these and
  of intermediate forms for a very long period before that in which
  they are first found. This may, however, be placed in connection
  with the appearance of an exogenous tree (<i>Syringoxylon</i>) in
  the Devonian, referred to in a previous chapter. It would be a
  strange and now little suspected case of imperfection of the
  record, if it should be found that trees of this type were
  lurking in exceptional corners through all the vast periods
  between the Devonian and the Cretaceous, to burst forth in
  unwonted variety and luxuriance in the latter period.</p>

  <p>The new Cretaceous flora appears first in beds which had been
  recently elevated from the ocean of the great Cretaceous
  subsidence; and when it first flourished, in temperate regions at
  least, the continents were of small dimensions, and broken up
  into groups of islands. Farther, America would seem to have had
  precedence of the Eastern Continent, and the Arctic of the
  Temperate regions. Thus on the elevation of the later Cretaceous
  land, plants previously established in the far north spread
  themselves southward, over newly-raised lands, radiating from the
  polar regions into Europe, Asia, and America. This seems the only
  way of accounting for the similarity of the plants in these
  distant countries. The new flora of the Upper Cretaceous in its
  journey southward met with a climate probably warmer than the
  present, yet not so warm as to prevent trees<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> similar
  to those now living in the same latitudes from flourishing.</p>

  <p>Let us now trace this flora through the succeeding ages, in
  which I shall follow pretty closely some general statements made
  by Count De Saporta in memoirs recently published.</p>

  <i>b</i>, <i>Diospyros pyrifolia</i> (Saporta). <i>c</i>,
  <i>Myrica Mathesonii</i> (Saporta).</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the Eocene we find a humid and warm
  climate in Europe, with great forests of oaks, chestnuts,
  laurels, giant pines, and other genera, some of them still
  European, others Asiatic or American, and many of them survivors
  of the Cretaceous (<a href="#f159">Figs.&nbsp;159 to 162</a>); and at the same period
  similar forests overspread those great plains of North America
  which were rising from out the Cretaceous sea, and there vast
  swampy beds were formed of vegetable <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, giving
  origin to beds of brown coal, some of them eighteen feet in
  thickness. Then came in Europe and Asia that great subsidence
  under the sea, during which the Nummuline limestones were
  deposited, and when the old continent was resolved again into an
  archipelago of islands, perhaps closely connected<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span> with
  more southern lands. This led to a great increase of southern
  forms of plants, which does not seem to have occurred to the same
  extent in America, where the flora is more continuous, though
  showing a warmer climate in the older than in the newer Eocene.
  At this period Palms, Screw pines, Proteaceous shrubs, Myrtles,
  Acacias, and other plants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196"
  id="Page_196">196</a></span> of the character of those of more
  southern climates were dominant in Europe (<a href="#f163">Fig.&nbsp;163</a>). The

  "FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href=

  the forests of sub-tropical India or Australia.</p>

  <p>Gradual elevation of the land favoured for a time the
  extension of these plants, and the warmth of the climate allowed
  them to extend even into Arctic latitudes. But in the middle of
  the Eocene another subsidence occurred, which exterminated much
  of the Eocene flora, and was perhaps accompanied with a reduction
  of temperature, in which the more northern lands became covered
  with great forests of trees allied to the Pines. In England a
  remarkable deposit of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197"
  id="Page_197">197</a></span>this age is that of Bovey Tracey, in
  Devonshire, where beds of clay and brown coal have afforded a
  rich flora of American and southern types. The <i>Sequoia</i>
  shown in <a href="#f164">Fig.&nbsp;164</a> abounds at this place, and is a near
  relation to the celebrated &ldquo;big trees&rdquo; of California;
  the <i>Cinnamomum</i> in <a href="#f165">Fig.&nbsp;165</a> is a type equally foreign
  from modern England. It is a curious feature of the Bovey deposit
  that immediately above these Eocene beds, holding a rich flora of
  warm temperate character, are glacial clays with leaves of Arctic

  <p>A striking result of recent discoveries is the fact that in
  Cretaceous and Eocene times a very warm climate prevailed in the
  extreme Arctic regions, and trees of temperate latitudes grew
  there freely. In the recent Arctic expedition, Captain Fielden
  found in latitude 81&deg; 40', within 600 miles of the Pole, a
  bed of lignite, from twenty-five to thirty feet in thickness,
  associated with remains of plants such as now grow only in
  temperate latitudes.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>&ldquo;From the character of the
  plant-remains, Dr. Heer infers that the lignite of this locality
  represents an ancient peat-moss, which must have been of wide
  extent, with reeds, sedges, birches, poplar, and certain conifers
  growing on its banks; while the higher and drier ground in the
  neighbourhood probably supported a growth of pines and firs, with
  elms and hazel-bushes. The remains of water-lilies suggest the
  existence of a fresh-water lake in the old peat-moss, which must
  have remained unfrozen during a great part of the
  year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is to be observed with reference to the age of these beds,
  that as the Later Cretaceous and Eocene flora of Europe and
  America migrated from the north, the plants found in the beds of
  that age in the temperate latitudes may really be somewhat older
  in the Arctic regions, a fact which produces some uncertainty as
  to their actual age.</p>

  <p>The warmth required for the growth of luxuriant forests near
  the Pole might be secured by a different distribution of land and
  water, and of the oceanic currents, but the requirements of
  plants as to light seem more difficult to meet, and it has been
  doubted whether species similar to those which are accustomed in
  modern times to regular alternations of day and night could
  submit to the long Arctic winter darkness. It is known, however,
  that in conservatories in Northern Russia plants supplied with
  heat and moisture can endure in winter great deprivation of
  light, and at Disco, in Greenland, roses and fuchsias flourish as
  house plants.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id=
  "FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class=
  "fnanchor">76</a> These facts show that if there were sufficient
  light and heat in summer, a great number of the plants of
  temperate latitudes could endure extreme cold and much
  deprivation of light in winter.</p>

  <p>It may be well here to inform the reader that some confusion
  as to the succession of the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras in
  America has arisen from the fact that the plants which are
  evidently Eocene in Greenland and America have been until lately
  incorrectly regarded as Miocene in Europe. In the</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

  <p>Western States, the Dakota group of Lesquereux is overlain by
  2000 feet of Cretaceous beds, containing the marine shells
  characteristic of that age, but no plants. But in
  Vancouver&rsquo;s Island these same Upper Cretaceous beds contain
  an abundant flora, which some botanists have called Tertiary for
  the reason already mentioned. Above the 2000 feet of marine beds
  overlying the Dakota group is the Lower Lignite group of
  Lesquereux, holding many fossil plants, including Palms and other
  evidences of a warmer climate than that of the Cretaceous, and
  which constitute a Lower Eocene flora corresponding in some
  respects to that of Europe. This is succeeded by an Upper Lignite
  group, also Eocene, but representing a more temperate climate,
  and therefore resembling more nearly the Cretaceous flora. This
  is nearly identical with the so-called Miocene of Greenland,
  Alaska, and Mackenzie River, which the facts collected by the
  Canadian geologists have shown to be really Eocene.<a name=
  "FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> But the Canadian
  reports containing these facts are comparatively little known in
  Europe, hence incorrect ideas as to the succession of these
  floras have been handed from one writer to another.</p>

  <p>To those who adopt extreme views as to the refrigeration of
  the northern hemisphere in so-called glacial times, there is
  great difficulty in accounting for the continued existence of the
  early Tertiary flora; but if we adopt moderate views as to this,
  and demand merely a great subsidence, with much reduction of mean
  temperature, we may suppose that the plants previously existing
  were preserved on insular spots, whence they were ready to
  recolonize the land on its emergence from the sea. It seems
  certain, however, that our continents never regained, after the
  Glacial period, the exuberance of plant life which they presented
  in the Miocene and earlier Pliocene; and we shall find that this
  statement applies to the world of animals as well as to that of
  plants. This reduction was more extreme in Europe than in Eastern
  Asia and Eastern</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

  <p>America, and the fact is thus accounted for in a recent
  lecture by Prof. Asa Gray:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I conceive that three things have conspired to this
  loss. First, Europe, hardly extending south of latitude 40&deg;,
  is all within the limits generally assigned to severe glacial
  action. Second, its mountains trend east and west, from the
  Pyrenees to the Carpathians and the Caucasus beyond, near its
  southern border; and they had glaciers of their own, which must
  have begun their operations, and poured down the northward
  flanks, while the plains were still covered with forest, on the
  retreat from the great ice-wave coming from the north. Attacked
  both on front and rear, much of the forest must have perished
  then and there. Third, across the line of retreat of those which
  may have flanked the mountain-ranges, or were stationed south of
  them, stretched the Mediterranean, an impassable barrier. Some
  hardy trees may have eked out their existence on the northern
  shore of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast. But we doubt
  not, <i>Taxodium</i> and Sequoias, Magnolias and Liquidambars, and even
  Hickories and the like, were among the missing. Escape by the
  east, and rehabilitation from that quarter until a very late
  period, were apparently prevented by the prolongation of the
  Mediterranean to the Caspian, and thence to the Siberian ocean.
  If we accept the supposition of Nordenski&ouml;ld, that, anterior
  to the Glacial period, Europe was &lsquo;bounded on the south by
  an ocean extending from the Atlantic over the present deserts of
  Sahara and Central Asia to the Pacific,&rsquo; all chance of
  these American types having escaped from or re-entered Europe
  from the south and east is excluded. Europe may thus be conceived
  to have been for a time somewhat in the condition in which
  Greenland is now, and indeed to have been connected with
  Greenland in this or in earlier times.<a name="FNanchor_78_78"
  id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class=
  "fnanchor">78</a> Such a junction, cutting off access of the Gulf
  Stream to the Polar Sea, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202"
  id="Page_202">202</a></span>would, as some think, other things
  remaining as they are, almost of itself give glaciation to
  Europe. Greenland may be referred to, by way of comparison, as a
  country which, having undergone extreme glaciation, bears the
  marks of it in the extreme poverty of its flora, and in the
  absence of the plants to which its southern portion, extending
  six degrees below the Arctic Circle, might be entitled. It ought
  to have trees, and might support them. But since destruction by
  glaciation no way has been opened for their return. Europe fared
  much better, but suffered in its degree in a similar way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turning for a moment to the American continent for a
  contrast, we find the land unbroken and open down to the tropic,
  and the mountains running north and south. The trees, when
  touched on the north by the on-coming refrigeration, had only to
  move their southern border southward, along an open way, as far
  as the exigency required; and there was no impediment to their
  due return. Then the more southern latitude of the United States
  gave great advantage over Europe. On the Atlantic border, proper
  glaciation was felt only in the northern part, down to about
  latitude 40&deg;. In the interior of the country, owing doubtless
  to greater dryness and summer heat, the limit receded greatly
  northward in the Mississippi Valley, and gave only local glaciers
  to the Rocky Mountains; and no volcanic outbreaks or violent
  changes of any kind have here occurred since the types of our
  present vegetation came to the land. So our lines have been cast
  in pleasant places, and the goodly heritage of forest-trees is
  one of the consequences.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The still greater richness of North-east Asia in
  arboreal vegetation may find explanation in the prevalence of
  particularly favourable conditions, both ante-glacial and recent.
  The trees of the Miocene circumpolar forest appear to have found
  there a secure home; and the Japanese islands, to which most of
  these trees belong, must be remarkably adapted to them. The
  situation of these islands&mdash;analogous to that of Great
  Britain, but with the advantage of lower latitude and greater
  sunshine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id=
  "Page_203">203</a></span>their ample extent north and south,
  their diversified configuration, their proximity to the great
  Pacific gulf-stream, by which a vast body of warm water sweeps
  along their accentuated shores, and the comparatively equable
  diffusion of rain throughout the year, all probably conspire to
  the preservation and development of an originally ample
  inheritance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The comparative paucity in species of the west coast of
  America, though the Sequoias and some other forms which have
  perished elsewhere are retained there, is admitted to be
  exceptional, and not easily explained, except by the supposition
  of peculiar local conditions affecting the comparatively narrow
  strip of land between the Rocky Mountains and coast ranges, and
  the Pacific.</p>

  <p>To such widely-distributed and varied and complex phenomena as
  those which have been discussed in the present chapter, it is
  impossible to do justice in the space at our command. Details in
  relation to them will be found in the publications of Heer, of
  Saporta, and of Lesquereux, and are well worthy of study by
  botanists, to whom alone they can be made fully intelligible. In
  general, with reference to now prevalent theories of derivation,
  they present two very dissimilar aspects. No difficulty can be
  greater to the evolutionist than to account for the simultaneous
  appearance of so many modern generic forms in the Cretaceous; and
  the fact of many of the genera presenting more and more species
  the farther we trace them back is a strange anomaly of evolution.
  On the other hand, the number of species continuing unchanged
  from the Eocene to the Modern, the others only slightly modified,
  and the representative species occurring in the floras of the old
  and new continents, appear to many to give great support to the
  doctrine of gradual transformation of species. Farther facts and
  farther comprehension of the difference between species and races
  will be necessary to the settlement of these questions. In the
  meantime it would appear that the Jurassic flora rapidly gave
  place, at a particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204"
  id="Page_204">204</a></span> point of geological time, to that of
  the modern world, and this not merely in one locality, but over
  the whole northern hemisphere; and there are apparently similar
  facts in the southern hemisphere as well. It farther appears that
  each genus was at first represented by many species, and that as
  time went on these were gradually reduced to a few best suited to
  survive; and that the changes of climate and level which occurred
  distributed these over different parts of the continents in a way
  at first sight very anomalous, but which Prof. Gray somewhat
  quaintly represents as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is as if Nature, when she had enough species of a
  genus to go round the four floral regions (Europe, East Asia,
  West America, and East America), dealt them fairly one at least
  to each quarter of our zone; but when she had only two of some
  peculiar kind, gave one to us, and the other to Japan,
  Mantchuria, or the Himalayas; and when she had only one, divided
  it between the two partners on the opposite sides of the
  table.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lastly, it seems very probable that many so-called species are
  nothing more than varietal forms, which may very well be modified
  descendants of Miocene or Eocene plants now figuring in our lists
  under different names.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205"

  <h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the reign of mammals.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/tcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "T" /><span class="smcap">he</span> incoming of that highest
  order of animals in which man himself, in so far as his physical
  nature is concerned, takes his place, presents some features
  which, though not unparalleled in the history of other forms of
  life, are still very striking. The modern Mammalia are somewhat
  sharply divided into three very unequal groups. First, those
  which present in their full perfection the property of producing
  fully developed young, which is one of the distinctive characters
  of the class. These are the Placental Mammals. Secondly, those in
  which the young are produced in a very imperfect condition, and
  are usually nourished for a time in a marsupium or pouch. These
  are hence called Marsupials. They are for the most part confined
  to Australasia, though a few occur in America; and are decidedly
  inferior in rank to the ordinary mammals. Thirdly, those in which
  there is a bird-like bill, and also certain bird-like or
  reptilian peculiarities of skeleton and of the alimentary canal.
  These are the Monotremes, represented by a very few species in
  Australia and New Guinea.</p>

  <p>In geological history, so far as the facts are at present
  known, the second group, that of the Marsupials, antedated the
  others by a vast lapse of time. The Marsupials appear in the
  Trias, near the beginning of the Mesozoic period. The
  Placentals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id=
  "Page_208">208</a></span> are not found until we reach the
  beginning of the Tertiary. The Monotremes would seem to be a
  comparatively modern degraded type. Thus the Marsupials existed
  throughout the reptilian age, and this in those countries of the
  northern hemisphere in which they are not now found. The Mesozoic
  Marsupials were, it is true, of small size, but there were
  probably numerous species, and though unable to cope with the
  great reptiles that swarmed by the shores and on the plains, they
  may have found abundant scope in the upland and interior regions
  of the continents.</p>

  <p>The Upper Trias of Germany has afforded to Professor
  Pleininger two teeth of a small mammal, to which the name of
  <i>Microlestes antiquus</i> has been given, under the impression
  that it was carnivorous, though it now seems more likely that it
  was a vegetable feeder. In rocks of nearly the same age in
  America, Emmons found a jaw-bone of another species
  (<i>Dromatherium sylvestre</i>), which has been supposed to be a
  near ally of the existing <i>Myrmecobius fasciatus</i> of
  Australia (<a href="#f166">Figs.&nbsp;166, 167</a>). In the Stonesfield slate, a member of
  the English Jurassic, several other species have been found
  (<a href="#f168">Fig.&nbsp;168</a>), and a still larger number in the freshwater beds
  of the Upper Purbeck. Marsh has obtained many others from the
  Jurassic of America. None appear to have yet been found in the
  Cretaceous, but they reappear in the Eocene Tertiary, and
  continue to the modern time. Their absence in the Cretaceous is
  probably a mere accident, and they present an illustration of a
  very permanent type little changed since its first introduction.
  Lyell enumerates in all thirty-three species from the Mesozoic,
  all of them of small size, and all more or less nearly related to
  existing Australian Marsupials, though differing much among
  themselves, and including both carnivorous and herbivorous forms
  (<a href="#f169">Fig.&nbsp;169</a>). Marsh has recently suggested a somewhat new
  interpretation of these interesting mammalian remains.<a name=
  "FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> He considers them
  divisible into two groups, one allied to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>the
  modern Insectivora (Moles, Shrews, Hedgehogs, &amp;c.), but of
  generalized forms. For these he constitutes a new order
  (<i>Pantotheria</i>, Marsh). The other group is less numerous and
  is Marsupial (<i>Allotheria</i>, Marsh). The jaws in <a href="#f166">Figs.&nbsp;166
  and 168</a> belong to the former group, that in <a href="#f169">Fig.&nbsp;169</a> to the
  latter. We should thus have both placental and Marsupial mammals
  in the Mesozoic. Marsh remarks that the descent of these
  different types from a common ancestry would require us to trace
  mammals back into the Pal&aelig;ozoic, that is, on the doctrine
  of gradual evolution.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the recent discoveries in America and in the east of
  Europe have almost thrown into the shade those researches of
  Cuvier in the Paris basin which first brought this important fact
  to light. The Eocene mammals, like the Carboniferous amphibians,
  the Mesozoic reptiles, and the Cretaceous forests, appear to
  spring full-grown from the earth, and this at nearly the same
  time in every part of the northern hemisphere. It has been
  suggested that they may have come in gradually without our
  knowledge in the Cretaceous period; but if so, we should have
  found some of their remains along with those of the Upper
  Cretaceous plants. But the prevalence of the great reptiles up to
  the close of the Cretaceous would seem to render the co-existence
  of large mammals unlikely. It has further been supposed that
  geological changes in the southern<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span> and northern hemispheres
  may have alternated with each other, so that there may be in the
  former Cretaceous beds in which the remains of ancestors of the
  Eocene mammals may be found. But we do not as yet know of such
  deposits. We may be content, therefore, to suppose that at the
  close of the Cretaceous there was established somewhere a sort of
  Eden for the first placental mammals, in which they were
  introduced and could live unharmed by the decaying monsters of
  the reptilian age, until the time came when they could increase
  and multiply and replenish the earth. The nearest approach to
  such a centre of mammalian life is perhaps to be found in those
  great American lake basins embedded in the mountains of the West,
  which have been so well described by Hayden and Newberry, and
  which have yielded so many animal remains to the researches of
  Leidy, Marsh, and Cope.</p>

  <p>The typical deposits of the Early Eocene have long been those
  of the Basin of Paris, where thick and highly fossiliferous
  deposits of this age rest on the more or less denuded surface of
  the Upper Chalk, and have afforded a rich harvest of<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span> remains
  of about fifty species of placental quadrupeds, whose bones have
  been found in the gypsum quarries of Montmartre. The great
  majority belong to the Ungulates, or hoofed animals, and the most
  abundant genera are those called by Cuvier
  <i>Pal&aelig;otherium</i> (<a href="#f170">Fig.&nbsp;170</a>) and
  <i>Anoplotherium</i>, of which there are several species, and
  which have affinities with the modern Tapirs on the one hand, and
  with the Horse on the other. Of the Unguiculate or clawed orders
  there are carnivorous forms allied to the Hy&aelig;na and the
  Fox, a Bat and a Squirrel; and the Marsupials are represented by
  an Opossum. Lyell describes a bed of clay associated with the
  gypsum, in which are numerous footprints, probably produced on
  the margin of a lake. Many of these might be referred to the
  Pal&aelig;othere and its allies; but there are others belonging
  to quadrupeds yet unknown, and there are also tracks of
  tortoises, crocodiles, and lizards, and of a large wading bird.
  Such a bed, perhaps deposited on the margin of a salt lake,
  resorted to as a &ldquo;lick&rdquo; by herbivorous animals, and
  by the carnivorous species which preyed on them, is well fitted,
  by the thronging life which it indicates, to teach how little we
  can know of the actual number and variety of the old inhabitants
  of the earth.</p>

  <p>In England, Eocene beds of the age of those of Paris, occupy
  the valley of the Thames and the Isle of Wight and neighbouring
  parts of Hants. They have afforded mammalian fossils similar to
  those of Paris, though less abundantly, but they are rich in
  remains of marine animals and of land plants.</p>

  <p>Instead of describing the well-known animals of the French and
  English Tertiaries, from these Eocene deposits upwards, I shall
  shortly sketch the succession in America, as worked out by Marsh
  and Cope, with the aid of the admirable summary given by Gaudry
  of the present state of knowledge with reference to the sequence
  of mammalian life from its appearance in the Early Eocene up to

  the most remarkable discoveries have been made in the Western
  Territories, where vast numbers of bones are imbedded in certain
  ancient and wide-spread lacustrine beds. It may be well to
  premise here that though the division into Eocene, Miocene, and
  Pliocene is recognised in America as well as in Europe, the
  limits of these groups may not precisely correspond with those in
  the Old World. Still we have this certain point of departure,
  that the Eocene begins where the peculiar animals of the
  Cretaceous end, and that the drying up of the later Cretaceous
  sea and the establishment of the Eocene land were probably nearly
  contemporaneous in both continents. It is true, however, in
  animals as in plants, that in the successive periods of the
  Tertiary, America presents an older aspect than Europe, just as
  its modern fauna still contains such old forms as the
  opossum.</p>

  <p>It would seem that as the mountain-ranges and table-lands of
  Western America emerged from the Cretaceous waters, they became
  clothed with Eocene forests and inhabited by Eocene mammals. But
  the waters, dammed up by surrounding ridges, formed large lake
  basins, which were drained only by the slow excavation of
  &ldquo;ca&ntilde;ons&rdquo; as the land rose still higher. In the
  successive deposits formed in these lakes both by ordinary
  deposition of silt and by paroxysmal showers of volcanic ashes
  were entombed great numbers of the animals which fed on their
  banks. It appears that these deposits, which in some places are
  estimated at not less than 8000 feet in thickness, hold the
  remains of three successive faunas, differing materially from
  each other, and representing the Lower, Middle, and Upper Eocene.
  On the flanks of the elevated region supporting the beds formed
  in the Eocene lakes, are other later lake basins of Miocene age,
  also abounding in animal remains. East of the Rocky Mountains,
  and also on the Pacific coast, are still later Pliocene
  deposits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id=

  The vast area of these formations and the complete sequence which
  they show are scarcely equalled elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The most characteristic animals of the lowest Eocene belong to
  the genus <i>Coryphodon</i> (<a href="#f171">Figs.&nbsp;171, 172</a>), which so abounded
  in Eocene America that bones of about 150 individuals were found
  by the Wheeler Expedition in one year in the Eocene beds of New
  Mexico. These animals in their dentition approached the American
  tapirs, except that they had great canines like the bear, while
  their feet resembled those of the elephant, and some of them
  attained the dimensions of the ox. <i>Coryphodon</i> is thus, as
  might be expected in a primal placental mammal, a creature of
  somewhat generalised type. Another point in which it resembles
  some at least of its early Tertiary contemporaries is the small
  size of the brain, especially in those parts of it supposed to
  minister to the intelligence and higher instincts (<a href="#f171">Fig.&nbsp;171</a>,
  <i>a</i>). It is certainly remarkable that as Tertiary time went
  on the successive groups of mammals were gifted with brains of
  larger and larger size, fitting them<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> for
  higher functions; and ultimately for associating with man.
  Animals thus low in development of brain were probably slow and
  sluggish and stubbornly ferocious, and dependent on brute force
  for subsistence and defence; and they would have been altogether
  unsuitable for domestication had they lived to the present
  time.</p>

  <p>In the Middle Eocene, the place of <i>Coryphodon</i> was taken
  by <i>Dinoceras</i> and allied forms. Some of the species nearly
  equalled the elephant in size, but had shorter and stouter limbs,
  each supported on five great toes&mdash;the most perfect possible
  sort of pedestal foot (<a href="#f172">Figs.&nbsp;172, 174</a>). They were heavily armed
  with immense canines on the upper jaws, and two or even three
  pairs of horns or hard protuberances on the head (<a href="#f173">Fig.&nbsp;173</a>).
  Creatures so supported and so armed, and<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span> living
  where food was plentiful, might well dispense with any great
  degree of intelligence, and their development of brain is
  consequently little better than that of <i>Coryphodon</i>. These
  great and characteristic Eocene families have no known
  successors; and in the Miocene age their place is taken by a very
  different group, that of which <i>Brontotherium</i> is the type
  (<a href="#f175">Fig.&nbsp;175</a>). They are creatures of huge size, with a pair of
  horn-cores on the nose, and feet with four toes in front and
  three behind, resembling in form those of the rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>While these gigantic Perissodactyles have no successors as yet
  known to us, another and less conspicuous Eocene type can be
  traced onward to modern times by a chain of successors which the
  imagination of evolutionists has converted into a veritable
  genetic series, to which they appeal as a
  &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; of the process of descent with
  specific modifications. In the Lower Eocene are found the remains
  of a diminutive ungulate (<i>Eohippus</i>), of the stature of a
  moderately-sized dog. It has four toes and a rudiment of a fifth
  in front, and three toes behind; and has teeth slightly
  resembling those of the horse, but more simple and shorter in the
  crown. In this creature it has been supposed that we have a
  direct ancestor of the modern horse. A very similar genus
  (<i>Orohippus</i>), lacking only the fifth rudimentary toe,
  replaces <i>Eohippus</i> in the Middle Eocene. <i>Mesohippus</i>
  of the Lower Miocene is as large as a sheep, and has only three
  toes on the fore-foot and a splint bone, while its teeth assume a
  more equine character (<a href="#f176">Fig.&nbsp;176</a>). In the Upper Miocene
  <i>Miohippus</i> continues the line, while <i>Protohippus</i> of
  the Lower Pliocene is still more equine and as large as an ass,
  and corresponds with the European <i>Hipparion</i> in having the
  middle toe of each foot alone long enough to reach the ground. In
  the Upper Pliocene true horses appear with only a single toe, and
  splint bones instead of the others. In America, though the horse
  was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id=
  "Page_219">219</a></span> unknown at the time of the discovery of
  the continent, several species occur in the Tertiary and
  Post-Pliocene, showing that the genus existed there up to a
  comparatively late period; and when re-introduced it has thriven
  and run wild in the more temperate regions. What cause could have
  led to its extinction in Post-Glacial times is as yet a mystery.
  This genealogy of the horse, independently of its evolutionist
  application, is very interesting. It shows that some Eocene types
  were suited to continuance, and even adapted for extension, while
  others were destined to become altogether extinct at an early
  date. It shows farther that the power of continuance resided not
  so much in the gigantic and prominent species as in smaller
  forms. It is to be observed, however, that Gaudry and other
  orthodox evolutionists in Europe deduce the horse, not from
  <i>Eohippus</i>, but from <i>Pal&aelig;otherium</i>, and that it
  is equally impossible to verify either phylogeny, since the mere
  sequence of more or less closely allied species in time does not
  prove continuous derivation. Nor indeed are we certain that
  one-toed horses like those now living did not exist on the dry
  plains in Eocene times, since the inhabitants of these plains are
  probably unknown to us. An amusing illustration of the probable
  reason of the disappearance of the missing links has recently
  been given by a writer not very favourable to the new philosophy.
  The several consecutive species may be represented by coins. We
  may suppose, for example, sixpences to have been coined first,
  then sevenpenny and eightpenny pieces, and so on up to a
  shilling, then pieces representing thirteen, fourteen and fifteen
  pence, and so on up to a half-crown or crown; but all the
  intervening denominations between the sixpence and the shilling,
  and between the shilling and the half-crown, were found
  practically of little use. Hence few were coined, and they soon
  became obsolete. Thus the antiquary would find only a few
  denominations, and those connecting them would be seldom or never
  found. It is plain that if we could suppose that nations
  constructed their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id=
  "Page_220">220</a></span> coinage after this unthinking and
  empirical fashion, and that if we were justified in ascribing a
  similar procedure to the Creator, it might help to account for
  the facts as we find them, otherwise we should rather suppose
  that in both cases something like plan and calculation determined
  the selection of the species produced, whether of coins or
  animals. But Chance is a blind goddess, and if we instal her as
  creator, we must expect the work to proceed by a series of
  abortive experiments.</p>

  <p>The Perissodactyls are not numerous at present. The three
  groups represented by the Horse, Rhinoceros, and Tapir constitute
  the whole; and the two latter forms can be traced back to
  predecessors in Eocene times, even more closely resembling them
  than those supposed to be ancestors of the horse resemble that
  animal. But the few species now living have thus a vast
  surplusage of possible ancestors. Many species and genera are
  dropped without any modern representatives, so that the tendency
  has been to a gradual elimination of surplus types, until only a
  few isolated and somewhat specialised forms remain at present.
  Yet this process of elimination is not necessarily an evolution
  or survival of the fittest, in the sense of modern
  derivationists. It rather implies that in certain past states of
  the earth the conditions of life afforded scope for many forms
  not now required, or replaced by other types more suited to the
  advanced and specialised nature of the world.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Artiodactyls have gained in numbers and
  importance, in comparison with their odd-toed comrades; and this,
  though an odd number, namely five, was the typical number with
  which the earliest quadrupedal forms began life far back in the
  Pal&aelig;ozoic. The typical Artiodactyls are those that cleave
  the hoof, and many of which also chew the cud; and they are of
  all others, the horse perhaps excepted, those that are most
  valuable to man. The lower type (Bunodont), to which the hog
  belongs, is the older; and many hog-like<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span> animals
  occur from the earlier Tertiary upwards. In the Upper Eocene,
  even-toed species appear with an approach at least to the
  crescent-shaped teeth of the modern deer and oxen. Some of the
  species are obviously forerunners of the modern antelopes and
  deer, though as yet destitute of horns or antlers. Others, like
  <i>Oreodon</i>, are of more hog-like aspect, though believed to
  have been ruminants (<a href="#f177">Fig.&nbsp;177</a>). These are characteristic of
  the Middle Miocene, at which stage true deer appear in Europe
  (<i>Dicroceras</i>), though they are not known in America until
  the Pliocene period. The earliest deer have small and simple
  antlers, these ornaments becoming larger and more elaborate in
  approaching the modern era. The hollow-horned ruminants appear
  for the first time in America in the Lower Pliocene; and no
  ancestry has so far been attempted to be traced for them. The
  antelopes of this group, as well as the gigantic
  <i>Sivatherium</i> of India,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
  "FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=

  <p>A very noteworthy and specially American group of mammals is
  that of the <i>Edentates</i>, the Sloths and Ant-eaters, a group
  which <i>&agrave; priori</i> we should have supposed would have
  been one of the earliest in time. They appear, however, first in
  the Miocene, without even any suggested ancestry, and are
  repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id=

  though they attain their grandest stature in the
  <i>Megatherium</i> and <i>Mylodon</i> of the Post-Pliocene (Figs.
  178, 179), which were sloths of so gigantic size that they must
  have pulled down trees to feed on their leaves, unless, indeed,
  there were trees equally colossal for them to climb. But before
  the modern time, like the American horses, the larger herbivorous
  forms suddenly disappear, and are now represented only by a few
  diminutive South American species, which can scarcely, by any
  stretch of imagination, be supposed to be descendants of their
  gigantic predecessors. The history of these animals, like those
  of the great Tertiary marsupials of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span> Australia and the many
  Miocene elephants of India, affords a remarkable illustration of
  the persistence of similar groups of creatures in successive ages
  in the same region, along with diminution in magnitude and number
  of species toward the modern times.</p>

  <p>The Whale-tribe (Cetaceans) at once in the earliest Eocene
  takes the place of the great Sea-lizards of the Cretaceous; and
  the oldest of the whales are in their dentition more perfect than
  any of their successors, since their teeth are each implanted by
  two roots, and have serrated crowns, like those of the Seals. The
  great Eocene whales of the Southern Atlantic (<i>Zeuglodon</i>)
  (<a href="#f180">Fig.&nbsp;180</a>), which have these characters, attained the length
  of seventy feet, and are undoubtedly the first of the whales in
  rank as well as in time. This is perhaps one of the most
  difficult facts to be explained on the theory of evolution.
  Allied to the whales is the small and peculiar group of
  the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id=
  "Page_224">224</a></span> Sea-cows or Dugongs (<i>Sirenians</i>).
  These creatures, highly specialised and very distinct from all
  others, appear in the Early Tertiary in forms very similar to
  those which now exist, and probably in much more numerous
  species, and they pursue the even tenor of their way down to
  modern times without perceptible elevation or degradation.
  &ldquo;We have questioned,&rdquo; says Gaudry, when speaking of
  the Tertiary Cetaceans, &ldquo;these strange and gigantic
  sovereigns of the Tertiary oceans as to their
  progenitors&mdash;they leave us without reply.&rdquo; Their
  silence is the more significant as one can scarcely suppose these
  animals to have been nurtured in any limited or secluded space in
  the early stages of their development. The true Seals, which are
  more elevated than the Whales, and very different in type, appear
  much later, and without any probable ancestry.</p>

  <p>The Elephants, two or three species of which constitute in the
  modern world the sole representatives of an order, are a remnant
  of an ancient race once vastly more numerous. They appear in
  Europe and Asia in the Miocene, when they were represented by
  three distinct genera (<i>Elephas</i>, <i>Mastodon</i>, and
  <i>Dinotherium</i>). The second genus (<a href="#f181">Fig.&nbsp;181</a>) differs
  from the proper Elephants in having tuberculated teeth,
  indicating a more swinish habit, and probably a more fierce
  disposition. The third (<a href="#f182">Fig.&nbsp;182</a>) is remarkable for the
  immense size of some of its species, far exceeding the modern
  Elephants, and has the farther peculiarity of a pair of
  descending tusks on the lower jaw, constituting a strong and
  heavy grubbing-hoe, with which it could probably dig deeply for
  roots. So important was the group in Miocene times that seven
  elephants are already known from this formation in India alone,
  besides three species of Mastodon. Four or five Miocene Mastodons
  are known in Europe, besides two <i>Dinotheria</i>; and the true
  Elephants appear there in the Pliocene, and continue to the
  beginning of the Modern. The elephantine animals are not known in
  America till the Pliocene, but in that and the Pleistocene, and
  perhaps up to the human period, the western continent, now
  altogether <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id=
  "Page_225">225<br />
  226</a></span> destitute of elephants, possessed several species
  both of <i>Elephas</i> and <i>Mastodon</i>, which extended, as in
  Siberia, even into the Arctic regions; and, as we know from
  specimens preserved in a frozen state in the latter region, some
  of the species were so protected by dense fur as to be able to
  endure extreme cold. The candid Gaudry closes his summary of the
  history and affinities of the elephantine animals with the words:
  &ldquo;However, the sum of the differences compared with that of
  the resemblances is too great to permit us to indicate any
  relation of descent between the proboscidians and the animals of
  other orders known to us at present.&rdquo; So these greatest of
  all the animals of the land, with their strangely specialised
  forms and almost human sagacity, stand alone, without father or
  mother, without descent.</p>

  <p>The Rodents, or gnawing animals, appear in the Early Eocene on
  both continents in familiar forms allied to our Squirrels
  and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id=

  in the Miocene. This group seems thus to have continued much as
  it was; and it is still perhaps represented by as many species as
  at any previous time. Many of the ancient forms were, however,
  much larger than any modern species, and some of these larger
  forms<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> present singular points
  of approach to very distinct types, as, for example, to that of
  the Bears; but these large and composite species are long since
  extinct. The insectivorous mammals have much the same history
  with the Rodents. Such highly specialised and abnormal forms as
  the Bats might be supposed to be modern. But, strange to say,
  they appear with fully developed wings both in Europe and America
  in the Eocene (<a href="#f183">Fig.&nbsp;183</a>). Gaudry thinks that it is
  &ldquo;natural to suppose&rdquo; that there must have been
  species existing previously with shorter fingers and rudimentary
  wings; but there are no facts to support this supposition, which
  is the more questionable since the supposed rudimentary wings
  would be useless, and perhaps harmful to their possessors.
  Besides, if from the Eocene to the present the Bats have remained
  the same, how long would it take to develop an animal with
  ordinary feet, like those of a shrew, into a bat?</p>

  <p>The Early Eocene was not altogether a time of peace in the
  animal world. The old carnivorous Saurians were dead and buried,
  but their place was taken by carnivorous mammals, allied to our
  modern Tigers, Hy&aelig;nas, Foxes, and Weasels. The Carnivora,
  however, were subordinate in the Eocene, and, as already
  remarked, some of them appear to be intermediate between
  marsupial and placental forms&mdash;a fact which evolutionists
  have noticed with much satisfaction. They appear to attain to
  their culmination in the Miocene, when their powers seem to be
  proportionate to those of the great and well-armed quadrupeds
  they had to deal with. To this age belongs the introduction of
  the terrible &ldquo;Cymetar-toothed Tiger&rdquo;
  (<i>Machairodus</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id=
  "Page_228">228</a></span> <a href="#f184">Fig.&nbsp;184</a>). Its huge tusk-like
  canines and powerful limbs seem to fit it more than any other of
  the cat family for destructive efficiency. Yet ordinary cat-like
  animals were contemporary with it, and have survived it, since
  Machairodus disappears in the Post-Pliocene, though in previous
  periods it had been very widely distributed on both continents.
  It is a curious fact, perhaps of more significance in various
  ways than we yet understand, that the Dog-bear
  (<i>Arctocyon</i>), of the oldest French Eocene, believed to be
  the oldest placental mammal known, though technically placed
  among the Carnivora, has a kind of dentition indicating that,
  like the modern Bears, it was really omnivorous; and its skull
  shows some peculiarities tending to those of the Marsupials.</p>

  <p>Much interest attaches to the first appearance of the order of
  Apes (<i>Quadrumana</i>), or, if we take the somewhat deceptive
  classification favoured by some modern zoologists, the
  <i>Primates</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id=
  "Page_229">229</a></span> including the apes and man. They begin
  in the Eocene, both in Europe and America, with the lowest tribe,
  that of the Lemurs, now confined to the island of Madagascar and
  parts of Africa and Southern Asia, and which may, Gaudry thinks,
  be modified Marsupials, though he admits that this is hard to
  understand. He mentions the resemblance of the teeth of monkeys
  to those of some hog-like animals, a resemblance, however, merely
  marking a similarity of food, and suggests on this ground that
  some of the primitive ancestors of the hog may have also given
  rise to the Monkeys. In the Miocene of Europe and Asia we have
  true Apes; and one of these, which rivals man in stature
  (<i>Dryopithecus</i>), belongs to the group of the gibbons, or
  long-armed apes, one of the higher families of the modern
  <i>Quadrumana</i> (<a href="#f185">Fig.&nbsp;185</a>). This animal presents, indeed,
  the nearest approach to man made by any Tertiary mammal. Still
  the differences are great, as, for instance, in the much larger
  size of the canines and premolars. Yet so much confidence has
  Gaudry in the resemblances, that he even ventures <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230<br />
  231</a></span> to suggest that certain flint chips found in the
  Miocene of Thenay, and which have been supposed to indicate human
  workmanship, may have been chipped by the hands of
  <i>Dryopithecus</i>. Should this view be adopted by
  evolutionists, it will at least have the effect of preventing
  flint chips from being received as evidences of the antiquity of
  man.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to sum up this review of the history
  of the Tertiary mammals. Much that has been said may be modified
  or changed by future discoveries; but the great facts of the late
  appearance of the placental mammals, of their rapid introduction,
  with their ordinal differentiation nearly complete over all the
  continents, of the speedy culmination and early decadence of many
  types, and of the unchanged permanence of others, must in the
  main be sustained. It is not too much to say that to account for
  these facts the evolutionist must abandon the idea of gradual
  change, and adopt that of &ldquo;critical periods&rdquo; when
  sudden changes occurred. The history becomes inexplicable, unless
  with Mivart, Le Conte, and Saporta, we admit &ldquo;periods of
  rapid evolution&rdquo; alternating with others of stagnation or
  retrogression; and if we admit these, we practically fall back on
  the old idea of creation; only it may perhaps be &ldquo;Creation
  by Law.&rdquo;</p>

  <h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">the advent of man.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/hcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "H" /><span class="smcap">itherto</span> we have met with no
  trace of man or of his works. Yet there have been in our upward
  progress from the dawn of life mute prophecies of his advent. Man
  is in his bodily frame a vertebrate animal and a mammal; and when
  first the Amphibians were introduced in the Pal&aelig;ozoic, the
  framework of man&rsquo;s body was already sketched out and its
  principles settled. Those great reptilian lords, the biped
  Saurians of the Mesozoic, already foreshadowed his erect posture,
  though their limbs may have been more ornithic than mammalian.
  The gradual advance in the brain-development of the Tertiary
  mammals presaged a coming time when mind would obtain the mastery
  over claw and tooth and horn; and in the Miocene ages there was
  already some hint of the precise style of structure in which this
  new creative idea would be realised. Yet it might have been
  impossible to imagine beforehand the vast changes which this new
  idea would inaugurate. In the lower animals such intelligence as
  they possess is so tied to the physical organisation that it
  manifests itself as a mechanical unvarying instinct. Man bursts
  this bond, and in doing so revolutionises the whole scheme of
  nature. Old things are now put to new uses, the face of nature is
  changed, varied arts are introduced, and thought enters into the
  domain of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id=
  "Page_234">234</a></span> general and abstract truth. Objects are
  arranged, classified, understood, and while in some respects the
  whole creation is made to groan under the tyrannous inventions of
  man, yet these are the inventions of imagination and design. They
  are the triumph, not of brute force, but of will and
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>That man was not in all the earlier ages of the world, except
  in these prophecies of his coming, geology assures us. That he
  is, we know. How he came to be, is, independently of Divine
  revelation, an impenetrable mystery&mdash;one which it is
  doubtful if in all its bearings science will ever be competent to
  solve. Yet there are legitimate scientific questions of great
  interest relating to the time and manner of his appearance, and
  to the condition of his earlier existence and subsequent history,
  which belong to geology, and in which so great stores of material
  have been accumulated that a treatise rather than a chapter would
  be required for their discussion. We may endeavour to select a
  few of the more important points.</p>

  <p>One of the first questions meeting us is that which relates to
  the point in geological time signalised by the advent of our
  species. In the Eocene period our continents were being gradually
  raised out of the ocean, and were still in great part under the
  waters, which several times returned upon the land, and seemed
  ready again to engulf it. In this period not only have we no
  traces of man, but all the higher animals of that age are now
  extinct. In the later Eocene and Miocene the extent of land
  became greater, but it was so disposed as to allow the influx
  into the Arctic Sea of vast volumes of heated water from the
  equatorial regions; and there may have been also astronomical
  causes at work to increase this influx of warm water, and so to
  raise the temperature of the Arctic regions still higher.<a name=
  "FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The middle period of
  the Tertiary was undoubtedly a time very favourable to the wide
  distribution of the higher forms of life both animal and
  vegetable. But we cannot trace <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>man or any of the
  contemporary mammals back to the Miocene. In the Pliocene the
  continents had attained to their present elevations, and climates
  were not dissimilar from those prevailing at present; but still
  we have no certain indication of the presence of man; and if
  other modern mammals extend back to this period their number is
  very small. In this age also the greater part of the continents
  must have been covered with a great thickness of soil and
  disintegrated rock favourable to vegetation, and there seemed
  nothing to preclude the introduction of man. But a new and at
  first sight most unfavourable change was to intervene. Whether
  through internal changes affecting the distribution of land and
  water, or through astronomical vicissitudes, the northern
  hemisphere, and possibly the whole world, entered on an era of
  refrigeration, the so-called &ldquo;Glacial Age&rdquo; of the
  Post-Pliocene or Pleistocene period. That in this period our
  continents as far south as the latitude of 40&deg; were
  overwhelmed with ice or ice-laden seas is rendered evident by the
  fact that the whole surface up to several thousands of feet above
  the sea-level has been bared of its accumulated
  <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and polished and grooved by ice, and laden
  with boulders and other glacial deposits, while in many places at
  heights of even 1,000 or 1,200 feet these deposits contain
  sea-shells of species now living in the colder parts of the
  ocean. These phenomena do not exist in the tropical regions,
  except in the vicinity of high mountains, but they recur in the
  southern hemisphere. It is still uncertain whether the period of
  greatest cold in the two hemispheres was at the same time or in
  successive ages. Geologically, however, they are approximately
  contemporaneous, both occurring between the end of the Pliocene
  and the modern period; but nevertheless they may not have
  coincided in absolute date.</p>

  <p>Very different views have been held as to the precise
  condition of the continents in the Glacial Age, though all agree
  in the prevalence of cold and the action of ice, and in the fact
  of a great submergence at one or more stages of the
  period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id=
  "Page_236">236</a></span> My own conclusions, which I have
  advocated elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id=
  "FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class=
  "fnanchor">84</a> and which are based on extensive study of the
  northern parts of America, where the deposits of this age are
  more widely developed than elsewhere, are that there was one
  great subsidence, leading to a condition in which the lower
  levels of the continents were covered with ice-laden water and
  the higher regions were occupied with permanent snow and
  glaciers. This submergence went on till even high mountains 4,000
  feet or more in elevation were under water. Then there was a
  gradual though intermittent elevation, during which the climate
  became ameliorated, and lastly there was a condition in which the
  land of the northern hemisphere stood higher than at present, and
  which immediately preceded the modern period. As these conditions
  have great significance in relation to the appearance of man, I
  have tabulated them for reference as they occur in Scandinavia,
  Great Britain, and North America. The so-called
  &ldquo;Interglacial Periods&rdquo; of some geologists are in
  reality local results of the stages of intermittent elevation in
  which were deposited beds which in some cases, as in Scotland,
  Sweden, and Eastern Canada, hold sea-shells, and in others, as in
  the central areas of North America, contain remains of plants of
  northern species.</p>

  <p>We shall name, for convenience, the parts of this Pleistocene
  revolution which include the great subsidence and glaciation, the
  <i>Glacial</i> Age, that extending from the re-elevation to the
  modern the <i>Post-glacial</i>.</p>

  <p>The Glacial Age proved fatal to a large proportion of the land
  life of the previous periods. According to Professor Boyd
  Dawkins, out of fifty-three species known in Britain in the
  Post-glacial, only twelve are survivors of the Pliocene; and
  probably the proportions would not be greater in any part of the
  northern hemisphere. Some, however, did survive, either by
  migrating southward or by being inhabitants of places less
  severely affected than most by the general cold and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=
  "Page_237">237</a></span>submergence. There was thus no absolute
  break in the chain of life effected by the Glacial Age.</p>

  <p>In what part of this sequence did man appear? In answer to
  this, I think it is now generally admitted that he is not
  certainly known earlier than the Post-glacial period. Various
  supposed indications of his presence in
  &ldquo;Inter-glacial&rdquo; Glacial, Pliocene, and even Miocene
  deposits have proved on examination to be unreliable. America has
  recently put forth claims to have been inhabited by man in the
  Pliocene, on the faith of remains found in auriferous gravels in
  the West. But the facts that the implements and bones found are
  modern in type, that the gravels were deeply mined by the
  Indians, and that the objects found, as mortars for dressing
  gravel, etc., are in many cases such as they would be likely to
  leave in their excavations, have discredited these supposed
  discoveries. Still more recently, chipped flints found in gravels
  in New Jersey, by Abbott, have been supposed to carry back the
  Indians of the East coast to the Glacial period. It is evident,
  however, from the description of these deposits by the late Mr.
  Belt and by Professor Cook, director of the Survey of New Jersey,
  that they are really Post-glacial, that their age must be
  estimated by study of the local conditions, and that there is no
  good ground for correlating them with the upper members of the
  true Glacial drift to the northwards, with which they had been
  somewhat rashly identified. Irrespective of the doubtful
  character of many if not all of the so-called implements, the
  deposits in which they are found is confessedly not a product of
  the ice of the Glacial period proper, whether that was, as some
  maintain, a period of land glaciation as far south as New Jersey
  or not. It belongs to a time of denudation by water, aided
  perhaps by floating ice, and is not necessarily older than the
  river gravels of the Somme, which, like it, contain boulders and
  imply conditions of torrential action and climate which have long
  since passed away. If, however, these implements are genuine,
  they would imply the presence of Pal&aelig;ocosmic or
  Antediluvian man in America. This would in itself be an important
  discovery.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span> For the present, therefore, man is
  geologically a Post-glacial species, and there is nothing
  unreasonable in supposing that he dates no farther back, since
  several animals his contemporaries are in the same case; and by
  supposing him to have originated after the Glacial age we avoid
  the difficulties attendant on his survival of that great
  revolution. The only necessity for supposing an earlier
  appearance arises from the requirements of the hypothesis of
  evolution. Those, however, who hold this theory, may with Haeckel
  take refuge in that shadowy continent supposed to have extended
  from Africa to Australia,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id=
  "FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class=
  "fnanchor">85</a> and to have sheltered man in his transition
  from the ape to humanity, in the Tertiary period. The name
  Lemuria is taken from the Lemurs, supposed ancestors of the Apes,
  which still haunt the margin of the Indian Ocean; but it may be
  taken also in its old Latin sense of ghosts of the evil dead; and
  as we are not likely to obtain any more tangible evidence of the
  old natives of Lemuria, perhaps we may hope that some
  spiritualist may succeed in charming them from the vasty deep for
  our enlightenment. Should this be so, it is to be hoped that no
  &ldquo;drum ecclesiastic&rdquo; will be beaten to drive them away
  till they have revealed all they can tell.</p>

  <p>It may be well to add that, in addition to the negative
  evidence, there is at least one positive evidence of the recent
  origin of man which has been well urged by Le Conte. It is this:
  animals have continued long in geological time in the inverse
  ratio of their rank. Some Mesozoic protozoa still survive. So do
  many early Tertiary mollusks. But the mammals are of much less
  duration. No living species goes back farther than the Pliocene.
  Few extend farther than the Glacial age. On the same principle it
  is not to be expected that man, the highest of all animals,
  should extend far back in geological time.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

  <p>Accepting the Post-glacial age as that of the advent of man,
  it may be interesting to ask what we know of the condition of our
  continents when he appeared. In Western Asia, in Europe, except
  in its more northern portions, and it would now seem also in
  America, man had been introduced at a time closely following the
  emergence of the land from the Glacial sea. At this time the land
  area of both continents was larger than it is at present, and the
  character of the fauna shows that much of the surface was
  occupied with great steppes or prairies, over which migration
  would be easy; while there were probably connections by land or
  chains of islands between the continents of the northern
  hemisphere. The land animals of the continents were more numerous
  and of greater stature than at present. Several species of

  fleet and active, and of immense size, inhabited Asia and Europe.
  Hippopotami, wild horses, the gigantic Irish stag, several
  species of wild cattle, and bisons of greater size than their
  successors, haunted the streams and steppes. The cave bear, the
  cave lion, the spotted hy&aelig;na, and possibly the
  <i>Machairodus</i>, were among the beasts of prey even in the
  temperate latitudes. The climate must have been a continental
  one, ranging through considerable extremes; but the conditions
  favoured migration of animals on the great scale, so as to avoid
  these extremes, and hence species of types now comparatively
  restricted enjoyed a wide distribution.</p>

  <p>To establish themselves in such a world, the primitive men
  must have been no puny race, either in mind or body, and they
  must have been sheltered in some Eden of plenty and comparative
  safety till, by increase of numbers, invention of weapons and
  implements, and domestication of useful animals, they became able

  powerful muscular development, especially in the lower limbs, of
  large brain, indicating great capacity and resources
  (<a href="#f188">Fig.&nbsp;188</a>), but of coarse Turanian features, like those of
  the tribes that now roam over the plains of Northern Asia (Fig.
  189). They used flint and bone implements, which they
  manufactured with much skill (<a href="#f190">Figs.&nbsp;190, 191</a>). They were probably
  clothed in dressed skins, ornamented with embroidery, in the
  manner of the North American Indians. They used shells and carved
  bones as ornaments. Recent discoveries at Soloutre, in France,
  render it probable that some of the tribes had tamed the horse,
  and resided in fortified villages. They buried their dead with
  offerings, indicating a belief in immortality. These Post-glacial
  men are certainly known as yet only in Europe and Western Asia;
  and we cannot therefore determine if they represent the average
  man of the period. There were in Belgium and other parts of
  Europe, men of smaller stature and of lower cranial type,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id=

  higher race. There may have been fruit-eating or agricultural

  of these early men, the Pal&aelig;olithic men of some writers, or

  <p>They were succeeded in Western Europe by a smaller and less
  elevated race, identical apparently with the modern Lapps and
  Basques, and in whose time the mammoth and many large animals had
  disappeared, Europe had become clad with dense forests, and the
  reindeer had extended his range far to the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> south,
  while the land of our continents had become narrowed to its
  present limits, or even less. The cause of these changes must
  have been physical, and to some extent cataclysmal; and its
  wide-spread and effectual character is shown by the fact that it
  exterminated so many animals of both continents which had
  survived the Glacial age. Similar testimony is borne by the
  occurrence of the implements and remains of Pal&aelig;ocosmic men
  in gravels and in diluvial clays in caverns, and by the changes
  of level and deep erosions of valleys that are referable to the
  close of the Pal&aelig;ocosmic age. The most probable agencies in
  this revolution were subsidences of the land, accompanied with
  climatal changes; but the precise nature and extent of these is
  still unknown; and the prevalent tendency<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span> on the
  part of geologists to stretch the doctrine of uniformity, so
  valuable within proper limits, to the absurd extreme of excluding
  all changes not exemplified even in amount in the modern period,
  will probably for some time prevent any adequate conception of
  them.</p>

  <p>It would be premature to correlate what is yet known of the
  Pal&aelig;ocosmic age with historical periods; but the tendency
  of the facts accumulated is, I think, toward the identification
  of the Pal&aelig;ocosmic men with the Antediluvians; and their
  Neocosmic successors, whether of the reindeer age, of the Danish
  shell-mounds, or the Swiss lake habitations, with Postdiluvian
  and still existing tribes.</p>

  <p>After what has been already said, it will be unnecessary to
  dwell upon the characteristics of the first race of men known to
  us. They were rude and uncivilised, in so far as outward
  appliances are concerned; but they are confessedly altogether
  men, and in no respect akin to apes, and their volume of brain is
  rather greater than that of the average European of to-day; so
  that they must have had quite as much natural sagacity and
  capacity for culture, and, like the modern and historic Turanian
  nations, they were probably superior to the average European in
  the instinct for art and construction. Thus if we suppose these
  men derived from apes by any process of gradual change, we must
  look for their brute ancestors, not in the Pliocene or Miocene,
  but in the Eocene itself. This causes us to recur to the doctrine
  of critical periods, when many species were introduced together,
  alternating with periods of decay and extinction. Post-glacial
  man appears at the end of a time of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> sifting and trial, a time
  in which a vast number of species succumbed to great physical
  reverses. No very great number of species came in with him, and
  in the early period of his history there was a decadence or
  destruction either by the diluvial cataclysm or gradually. Out of
  ninety-eight species of mammals contemporary with early man in
  Europe, forty-one <span class="figleft" style=
  "width: 150px;"><a name="f191" id="f191"></a><img src=
  "images/fig_191.png" width="150" height="752" alt="Bone Harpoon."
  title="" /> <span class="small"><span class=
  "smcap">Fig.&nbsp;191.</span>&mdash;Bone Harpoon
  (Pal&aelig;ocosmic), from P&eacute;rigord Cavern.</span></span>
  are wholly or locally extinct, and none have been introduced
  except those brought by man himself. Thus man stands alone, the
  grand product of his period and a lord of creation, for whom
  great preparatory changes were made, and multitudes of lower
  animals swept away to make room for him. According to our sacred
  Scriptures, this change is still imperfect, and great additional
  ameliorations would have taken place but for a moral catastrophe
  not within the domain of geology&mdash;the fall of man. If we
  identify the Pal&aelig;ocosmic men with the Antediluvians of the
  same venerable record, the roving tribes whose remains are known
  to us represent that part of the race of Cain of whom Jubal was
  the father, the nomads dwelling in tents, as distinguished from
  the settled agricultural peoples. In this case, also, the
  catastrophe which destroyed these rude and lawless men was that
  which culminated in the deluge of Noah, which may represent the
  extinction of the last great body of this primitive race, whose
  arts, handed down to the physically inferior men of Postdiluvian
  times, astonish us by their early development in Chald&aelig;a
  and in Egypt.</p>

  <p>If man is so recent geologically, he may still be very old
  historically; and the question remains, Have we any facts bearing
  on the absolute antiquity of man? For the properly <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
  historical aspect of this question, I may refer to the excellent
  work of Canon Rawlinson on the <i>Origin of Nations</i>,<a name=
  "FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> which shows
  conclusively that the historic origin of all the great nations of
  antiquity extends backward less than 4,400 years from our time.
  Beyond this we have, however, the Pal&aelig;ocosmic or
  Antediluvian men; and their extension backward seems limited
  geologically only by the close of the Glacial period, while many
  hold that the Genealogy in Genesis does not require us to limit
  very narrowly their antiquity. The date of the Glacial period is,
  however, at present very uncertain. On the one hand, some
  geologists, like Lyell, have supposed it may be as far back as
  200,000 years ago. Others, like Croll, are contented with the
  more moderate estimate of 80,000 years. On the other hand, the
  calculations of Andrews, based on the recession of the American
  lakes, those of Winchell on the recession of the Falls of St.
  Anthony, and the recent surveys of the recession of the Falls of
  Niagara, reduce the time to from 7,000 to 10,000 years. It is
  impossible in the present state of knowledge to settle these
  disputes; but one may refer in the sequel to some of the
  evidences which have been adduced in favour of great antiquity.
  Since the publication of the second edition of this work Prof.
  Prestwich, in a paper read before the Geological Society,<a name=
  "FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> has brought forward
  other reasons which induce him to conclude that the close of the
  Glacial epoch occurred &ldquo;from 8,000 to 10,000 years
  since.&rdquo; It is true, he admits, on geological evidence still
  in dispute, that man may have existed in Europe before that time,
  and he also admits, on historical, not geological evidence, the
  existence of &ldquo;Neolithic&rdquo; man in Asia, &ldquo;at an
  earlier date than 4,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&rdquo;
  Still the repudiation, by so good an authority, of the
  exaggerated antiquity which it has been the fashion, since the
  rise of Darwinian evolution, to assign to man, contrary to the
  geological evidence, is a satisfactory indication of a return to
  more rational views; and when geologists get rid of the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id=
  "Page_248">248</a></span>fiction of a continental ice-sheet,
  still farther progress in this direction may be expected.</p>

  <p>We may, I think, at once take it for granted, that none of the
  Neocosmic races date farther back than the origin of the great
  eastern nations. There are certainly no geological evidences
  requiring a greater antiquity, for in their time the land had
  attained to its present configuration, and the changes which have
  occurred in the succession of forests and the growth of peat are
  such as our experience in America shows to be possibly quite
  modern. There is besides no doubt that these people, from the
  Reindeer men of France and Belgium to the people of the Swiss
  lakes, are modern races, whose descendants still live in Europe.
  We can thus limit our inquiry to the Pal&aelig;ocosmic men; and
  with respect to them we know only what may be gathered from a
  consideration of the physical changes which have occurred since
  they lived.</p>

  <p>In Europe a great number of considerations have been adduced
  as evidence of their high antiquity; and these deserve careful
  attention, though I think it will be found that they are all
  liable to serious objections or great abatements on geological
  grounds.</p>

  <p>(1) The occurrence of human remains with those of animals now
  extinct affords no certain evidence of antiquity. Admitting that
  human remains are found along with those of the mammoth in
  Europe, and with those of the mastodon in America, the question
  remains, How late did these species survive? In Europe we know
  that several large animals now extinct existed up to
  comparatively modern times. This is the case with the Irish deer
  (<i>Megaceros</i>), the urus, the aurochs, and the reindeer, in
  temperate Europe. How long previously the mammoth or the hairy
  rhinoceros disappeared we do not know, but need not suppose the
  time very long.</p>

  <p>(2) The accumulation of sediment or of stalagmite over human
  remains in caverns is not necessarily indicative of very great
  antiquity. We know that in favourable circumstances mud, sand,
  and gravel may be rapidly deposited in caves by land<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span> floods
  or river inundations, and that <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of various
  sorts accumulates in such places from decay of rock and vegetable
  and animal agencies. The deposition of stalagmite is also very
  variable in its rate; and the fact that it is being very slowly
  deposited in any cave now does not prove that more rapid
  deposition may not have taken place formerly. Dawkins and others
  have ascertained a rate of a quarter of an inch per annum in some
  caverns; and this would allow the stalagmite crust of
  Kent&rsquo;s cave, for which an antiquity of half a million of
  years has been claimed, to have been formed in a thousand
  years.</p>

  <p class="center2"><span class=
  "smcap">Fig.&nbsp;192.</span>&mdash;Sketch of a Mammoth, carved
  on a portion of a Tusk of the same Animal (Lartet).</p>

  <p>(3) The erosion of river valleys to great depths since the
  Glacial period fails to establish the great antiquity of the
  caves left on their sides or the high level gravels of their
  banks. Throughout the northern hemisphere, the river valleys are
  of old date, and were merely filled with loose detritus in the
  Glacial age. The sweeping out of this <i>d&eacute;bris</i> would
  be a rapid process, more especially when changes of level were
  occurring, and when the rainfall was greater than at present.
  Besides, as Croll has well remarked, the actual configuration of
  our continents, the amount of drift still remaining, and the
  imperfect manner in which the river valleys have been cleared
  out, all testify to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id=
  "Page_250">250</a></span> the comparative recency of the Glacial
  period.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> These considerations
  would, indeed, materially reduce the antiquity which he claims on
  astronomical grounds for the ice age.</p>

  <p>(4) The growth of peat and the deposition of silt are very
  deceptive as indications of great antiquity. For instance,
  accurate observations made by a French engineer in the
  construction of docks at St. Nazaire,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id=
  "FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class=
  "fnanchor">92</a> show that in 1,600 years the Loire had
  deposited over Gallo-Roman remains six metres of mud. Relics of
  the Bronze age occur below these at a depth indicating 500 years
  previously as their date; and the beginning of the modern deposit
  of the Loire would, on the same evidence, be only 6,000 years
  ago. Hilgard&rsquo;s observations on the delta of the Mississippi
  in like manner tend greatly to reduce our estimates of the time
  occupied in the deposit of the modern silt of that river. The
  peat deposit at Abbeville, at the mouth of the Somme, has been
  supposed to have required 30,000 years for its formation. But
  this estimate was based upon the present rate of growth; and, as
  Andrews has shown, the fact admitted by Boucher de Perthes, that
  birch stems three feet high stand in this peat, implies a much
  more rapid rate, which is also proved by the depth at which Roman
  remains have been found. In like manner the Scandinavian peats,
  to which a fabulous antiquity has been ascribed, have been proved
  to be comparatively modern by the depths at which metallic works
  of art are found in them.</p>

  <p>(5) The paucity of remains of Pal&aelig;ocosmic men in Europe,
  with their wide distribution, indicate that their sojourn was not
  long, or that the population was very small and much scattered.
  Even in a few thousands of years, an active and vigorous people,
  living in a country well supplied with food, must have multiplied
  greatly, and must have left considerable remains. On the theory
  that these men inhabited Europe even for 2,000 years, we have to
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id=
  "Page_251">251</a></span>suppose that the greater part of their
  remains have been swept away, or remain under the waters, or
  buried out of sight in diluvial sediments.</p>

  <p>(6) Much importance has been attached to the early works and
  high culture of Egypt and Chald&aelig;a, as evidence of vast time
  during which arts were growing from a supposed rude stone age.
  But it must be observed that no such period is known to antedate
  civilisation in the East, and that if the early empires were
  established by survivors of the Deluge, they must have brought
  with them the culture of Antediluvian times. Farther, the notion
  of men emerging from a half-brutal state, and from the use of the
  rudest implements, is purely conjectural and not supported by
  facts. In America, where the semi-civilised agricultural races
  are unquestionably the oldest, the rudest possible implements
  were used by these partially civilised agricultural people along
  with polished stone and metal; and Schliemann has shown that a
  rude stone age succeeded the civilisation of Troy, and this at a
  time when Ph&oelig;nicia and Egypt were at the height of their
  civilisation. Such facts, which might fill volumes, show how
  little value is to be attached to supposed ages of rough and
  polished stone.</p>

  <p>(7) The difficulties attending the establishment of geological
  dates for deposits like those containing the remains of men are
  very great. They are altogether superficial and local, not
  widespread marine beds in which a distinct order of superposition
  can be clearly traced. They are not easily separated from the
  glacial beds below, or from those above which have been modified
  by human agency, by land-floods, or by landslips. Thus the
  application of geological criteria of age to them is very
  difficult and uncertain. Evidence of this could easily be given,
  in the many errors which have been promulgated, and which have
  had to be retracted by their authors, or have been disproved by
  the observations of others. For example, no country was at one
  time richer in supposed evidences of the antiquity of man than
  Scandinavia; but Professor Torell, the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
  director of the Geological Survey of Sweden, has recently made a
  careful re-examination of the facts, and has found that there is
  no evidence whatever of the existence of man in Scandinavia
  before the Neolithic or polished stone age. There are, however,
  evidences of considerable changes of level since that time, and
  it would seem even since the twelfth century of our era. The
  remarkable and seemingly inexcusable errors of observation
  referred to in Professor Torell&rsquo;s memoir, should enforce a
  caution on geologists as to the uncertainties of such evidence.
  Lyell sifted the testimony bearing on this subject with great
  care in the first edition of his <i>Antiquity of Man</i>. In
  later editions he had to make large abatements, and now much of
  the evidence in the latest edition would have to be withdrawn or
  otherwise applied.</p>

  <p>From all these considerations the conclusion is obvious that
  while we have no certain data for assigning a definite number of
  years to the residence of man on the earth, we have no geological
  evidence for the rash assertion often made that in comparison
  with historical periods the date of the earliest races of men
  recedes into a dim, mysterious, and measureless antiquity. On the
  basis of that Lyellian principle of the application of modern
  causes to explain past changes, which is the stable foundation of
  modern geology, we fail to erect any such edifice as the
  indefinite antiquity of man, or to extend this comparatively
  insignificant interval to an equality with the long &aelig;ons of
  the preceding Tertiary. The demand for such indefinite extension
  of the history of man rests not on geological facts, but on the
  necessities of hypotheses which, whatever their foundation, have
  no basis in the discoveries of that science, and are not required
  to account for the sequence which it discloses.</p>

  <h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

  <h4><span class="smcap">review of the history of
  life.</span></h4>

  <p><img src="images/wcap.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
  "W" /><span class="smcap">hat</span> general conclusions can we
  reach as to this long and strange history of the progress of life
  on our planet? Perhaps the most comprehensive of these is that
  the links in the chain of life, or rather in its many chains, are
  not scattered and disunited things, but members of a great and
  complex plan; and that when we discern their combinations and
  their pattern, we find them not only orderly and symmetrical, but
  all tending to one point and bound to one central object, even
  the throne of the Eternal. It must also appear evident that the
  original plan of nature, both in the animal and vegetable worlds,
  was too vast to be realised at one time on a globe so limited as
  ours, but had to be distributed in time as well as in space, thus
  realising the idea of time-worlds: successive &aelig;ons in
  which, one after the other, the work of creation could rise to
  successive stages of perfection and completeness till it
  culminated in man. All this is sufficiently plain on the theistic
  view of nature, and may suffice for those who reverently regard
  the God of nature as the Father of their own spirits. But there
  are others who ask further questions. Do we know anything of the
  secondary causes and origin of life, of the manner of its
  introduction and advance, of the laws of its succession?</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span> As to the first of these questions, it
  is certain that, up to this time, the origination of the living
  being from the non-living is an inscrutable mystery. No one has
  witnessed this change, or has been able to effect it
  experimentally. Nor have we any direct evidence of the
  origination of one specific type from another. Such reasonings as
  assume the possibility of these things, or on analogical grounds
  assert their probability, belong rather to the domain of
  philosophical speculation than to science. As to the laws of the
  succession of life, however, it is possible to learn something
  from the sequence of facts as already ascertained; and though
  much remains to be discovered, there are a few leading statements
  on this subject which can already be made with safety.</p>

  <p>Unity and uniformity, within the limits imposed by progress
  and increasing complexity, can be affirmed of the whole process.
  From the dawn of life to the present time the great laws of
  physical nature which operate on animals and plants have been
  uniform. These stable laws have regulated the action of the outer
  world on organisms. The plans of structure of these organisms
  laid down at the first have been followed throughout. Thus the
  succession of life presents nothing fortuitous or arbitrary, but
  a continuous plan carried out uniformly in time and space, with
  certain materials of fixed properties, and with certain
  structures predetermined from the first. There is, for example, a
  great sameness of plan throughout the whole history of the marine
  invertebrate life of the Pal&aelig;ozoic. If we turn over the
  pages of an illustrated text-book of geology, or examine the
  cases or drawers of a collection of fossils, we shall find
  extending through every succeeding formation, representative
  forms of Crustaceans, Mollusks, and Corals, in such a manner as
  to indicate that in each successive period there has been a
  reproduction of the same type with modifications; and if the
  series is not continuous, this appears to be due to lack of
  specimens, or to abrupt physical changes; since sometimes, where
  two formations pass into each other, we find<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span> a
  gradual change in the fossils by the dropping out and
  introduction of species one by one. Thus in the whole of the
  great Pal&aelig;ozoic period, both in its fauna and flora, we
  have a continuity and similarity of a most marked character.</p>

  <p>There is, indeed, nothing to preclude the supposition that
  many forms reckoned as species are really only race
  modifications. My own provisional conclusion, based on the study
  of Pal&aelig;ozoic plants, published many years ago,<a name=
  "FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> is that the general law
  will be found to be the existence of distinct specific types
  independent of each other, but liable in geological time to minor
  modifications, which have often been regarded as distinct
  species.</p>

  <p>While this unity of successive faun&aelig; at first sight
  presents an appearance of hereditary succession, it loses much of
  this character when we consider the number of new types
  introduced without apparent predecessors, or ceasing without
  successors, and the almost changeless persistence of other types;
  the necessity that there should be similarity of type in
  successive faun&aelig; on any hypothesis of a continuous plan;
  and, above all, the fact that the recurrence of representative
  species or races in large proportion marks times of decadence
  rather than of expansion in the types to which they belong. To
  return to a later period, this is very manifest in that singular
  resemblance which obtains between the modern mammals of South
  America and Australia and their immediate fossil
  predecessors&mdash;the phenomenon being here manifestly that of
  decadence of large and abundant species into a few depauperated
  representatives. This will be found to be a very general law,
  elevation being accompanied by the abrupt appearance of new
  types, and decadence by the apparent continuation of old species,
  or modifications of them.</p>

  <p>This resemblance with difference in successive faun&aelig;
  also connects itself very directly with the successive elevations
  and depressions of our continental plateaus in geological
  time.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

  <p>Every great Pal&aelig;ozoic limestone, for example, indicates
  a depression with succeeding elevation. On each elevation marine
  animals were driven back into the ocean, and on each depression
  swarmed in over the land, reinforced by new species, either then
  introduced or derived by migration from other localities. In like
  manner on every depression, land plants and animals were driven
  in upon insular areas, and on re-elevation again spread
  themselves widely. Now I think it will be found to be a law here
  that periods of expansion were eminently those of introduction of
  new specific types, and periods of contraction those of
  extinction, and also of continuance of old types under new
  varietal forms. It must also be borne in mind that all the
  leading types of invertebrate life were early introduced, that
  change within these was necessarily limited, and that elevation
  could take place mainly by the introduction of the vertebrate
  orders. So in plants, Cryptogams early attained their maximum as
  well as Gymnosperms, and elevation occurred in the introduction
  of Ph&aelig;nogams.</p>

  <p>Another allied fact is the simultaneous appearance of like
  types of life in one and the same geological period, over widely
  separated regions of the earth&rsquo;s surface. This strikes us
  especially in the comparatively simple and homogeneous
  life-dynasties of the Pal&aelig;ozoic, when for example we find
  the same types of Silurian Graptolites, Trilobites and
  Brachiopods appearing simultaneously in Australia, America, and
  Europe. Perhaps in no department is it more impressive than in
  the introduction in the Devonian and Carboniferous ages of that
  grand cryptogamous and gymnospermous flora which ranges from
  Brazil to Spitzbergen, and from Australia to Scotland,
  accompanied in all by the same groups of marine invertebrates; or
  in the like wholesale production of modern types of trees in the
  Cretaceous. Such facts may depend either on that long life of
  specific types which gives them ample time to spread to all
  possible habitats, before their extinction; or on some general
  law whereby the conditions suitable to similar types
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id=
  "Page_257">257</a></span> life emerge at one time in all parts of
  the world. Both causes may be influential, as the one does not
  exclude the other, and there is reason to believe that both are
  natural facts. Should it be ultimately proved that species allied
  and representative, but distinct in origin, come into being
  simultaneously everywhere, we shall arrive at one of the laws of
  creation, and one probably connected with the gradual change of
  the physical conditions of the world.</p>

  <p>A closely related truth is the periodicity of introduction of
  species. They come in by bursts or flood-tides at particular
  points of time, while these great life-waves are followed and
  preceded by times of ebb in which little that is new is being
  produced. We labour in our investigation of this matter under the
  disadvantage that the modern period is evidently one of the times
  of pause in the creative work. Had our time been that of the
  early Tertiary or early Mesozoic, our views as to the question of
  origin of species might have been very different. It is a
  striking fact, in illustration of this, that since the Glacial
  age no new species of mammal can be proved to have originated on
  our continents, while a great number of large and conspicuous
  forms have disappeared. It is possible that the proximate or
  secondary causes of the ebb and flow of life-production may be in
  part at least physical; but other and more important efficient
  causes may be behind these. In any case these undulations in the
  history of life are in harmony with much that we see in other
  departments of nature.</p>

  <p>It results from the above and the immediately preceding
  statement that specific and generic types enter on the stage in
  great force, and gradually taper off toward extinction. They
  should so appear in the geological diagrams made to illustrate
  the succession of life. This applies even to those forms of life
  which come in with fewest species and under the most humble
  guise. What a remarkable swarming, for example, there must have
  been of Marsupial Mammals in the early Mesozoic; and<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span> in the
  Coal formation the only known Pulmonates, four or five in number,
  belong to as many generic types.</p>

  <p>I have already referred to the permanence of certain species
  in geological time. I may now place this in connection with the
  law of origination and more or less continuous transmission of
  varietal forms. I may, perhaps, best illustrate this in
  connection with a group of species with which I am very familiar,
  that which came into our seas at the beginning of the Glacial
  age, and still exists. With regard to their permanence, it can be
  affirmed that the shells now elevated in Wales to 1,200 and in
  Canada to 600 feet above the sea, and which lived before the last
  great revolution of our continents, a period vastly remote as
  compared with human history, differ in no tittle from their
  modern successors after thousands or tens of thousands of
  generations. It can also be affirmed that the more variable
  species appear under precisely the same varietal forms then as
  now, though these varieties have changed much in their local
  distribution. The real import of these statements, which might
  also be made with regard to other groups well known to
  pal&aelig;ontologists, is of so great significance that it can be
  realised only after we have thought of the vast time and numerous
  changes through which these humble creatures have survived. I may
  call in evidence here a familiar British and American animal, the
  common sand clam, <i>Mya arenaria</i>, and its relative, <i>Mya
  truncata</i>, which now inhabit together all the northern seas;
  for the Pacific specimens, from Japan and California, though
  differently named, are undoubtedly the same. <i>Mya truncata</i>
  appears in Europe in the older Pliocene, and was followed by
  <i>M. arenaria</i> a little later. Both shells occur in the
  Pleistocene of America, and their several varietal forms had then
  already developed themselves, and remain the same to-day; so that
  these humble mollusks, littoral in their habits, and subjected to
  a great variety of conditions, have continued, perhaps for one or
  two thousand centuries, to construct their shells precisely as at
  present. Nor are there any<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span> indications of a
  transition between the two species. Similar statements may be
  made with regard to other mollusks of the Pliocene and Modern
  periods, and there are even species which extend unchanged from
  the early Eocene. Nor is it impossible that some modern bivalves
  of the Brachiopod group may be scarcely modified descendants even
  of Pal&aelig;ozoic species.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of the most remarkable facts in connection with
  the permanence of species and varietal forms are those furnished
  by that magnificent flora which burst in all its majesty on the
  American continent in the Cretaceous period, and still survives
  among us even in some of its specific types, I say survives; for
  we have but a remnant of its forms living, and comparatively
  little that is new has probably been added since. Take, for
  example, the facts stated in Chapter VIII. as to the continuance
  to the present time of species of plants introduced in the
  Cretaceous and Eocene, and which thus came in at the very time
  when the great Mesozoic reptiles were decaying or had just
  disappeared, and when the placental mammals were being
  introduced. Some of these plants must have propagated themselves
  unchanged for half a million of years.</p>

  <p>Plants and the lower tribes of animals are, however, more
  permanent than the higher animals; and a strange contrast is
  afforded to the foregoing examples of persistence by the repeated
  revolutions that have affected vertebrate life since the Mesozoic
  age. Yet even in the case of vertebrates there seems to have been
  little change, except in the extinction of species, since the
  Pliocene period.</p>

  <p>In conclusion of this review, can we formulate a few of the
  general laws, or perhaps I had better call them the general
  conclusions respecting life, in which all pal&aelig;ontologists
  may agree? Perhaps it is not possible to do this at present
  satisfactorily, but the attempt may do no harm. We may, then, I
  think, make the following affirmations:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span> (1) The existence of life and
  organisation on the earth is not eternal, or even coeval with the
  beginning of the physical universe, but may possibly date from
  Laurentian or immediately pre-Laurentian times.</p>

  <p>(2) The introduction of new species of animals and plants has
  been a continuous process, not necessarily in the sense of
  derivation of one species from another, but in the higher sense
  of the continued operation of the cause or causes which
  introduced life at first. This, as already stated, I take to be
  the true theological or Scriptural as well as scientific idea of
  what we ordinarily and somewhat loosely term creation.</p>

  <p>(3) Though thus continuous, the process has not been uniform;
  but periods of rapid production of species have alternated with
  others in which many disappeared and few were introduced. This
  may have been an effect of physical cycles reacting on the
  progress of life.</p>

  <p>(4) Species, like individuals, have greater energy and
  vitality in their younger stages, and rapidly assume all their
  varietal forms, and extend themselves as widely as external
  circumstances will permit. Like individuals, also, they have
  their periods of old age and decay, though the life of some
  species has been of enormous duration in comparison with that of
  others; the difference appearing to be connected with degrees of
  adaptation to different conditions of life.</p>

  <p>(5) Many allied species, constituting groups of animals and
  plants, have made their appearance at once in various parts of
  the earth, and these groups have obeyed the same laws with the
  individual and the species in culminating rapidly, and then
  slowly diminishing, though a large group once introduced has
  rarely disappeared altogether.</p>

  <p>(6) Groups of species, as genera and orders, do not usually
  begin with their highest or lowest forms, but with intermediate
  and generalised types, and they show a capacity for both
  elevation and degradation in their subsequent history.</p>

  <p>(7) The history of life presents a progress from the lower to
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id=
  "Page_261">261</a></span> the higher, and from the simpler to the
  more complex, and from the more generalised to the more
  specialised. In this progress new types are introduced, and take
  the place of the older ones, which sink to a relatively
  subordinate place, and become thus degraded. But the physical and
  organic changes have been so correlated and adjusted that life
  has not only always maintained its existence, but has been
  enabled to assume more complex forms, and that older forms have
  been made to prepare the way for newer, so that there has been on
  the whole a steady elevation culminating in man himself.
  Elevation and specialisation have, however, been secured at the
  expense of vital energy and range of adaptation, until the new
  element of a rational and inventive nature was introduced in the
  case of man.</p>

  <p>(8) In regard to the larger and more distinct types, we cannot
  find evidence that they have, in their introduction, been
  preceded by similar forms connecting them with previous groups;
  but there is reason to believe that many supposed representative
  species in successive formations are really only races or
  varieties.</p>

  <p>(9) In so far as we can trace their history, specific types
  are permanent in their characters from their introduction to
  their extinction, and their earlier varietal forms are similar to
  their later ones.</p>

  <p>(10) Pal&aelig;ontology furnishes no direct evidence, perhaps
  never can furnish any, as to the actual transformation of one
  species into another, or as to the actual circumstances of
  creation of a species, but the drift of its testimony is to show
  that species come in <i>per saltum</i>, rather than by any slow
  and gradual process.</p>

  <p>(11) The origin and history of life cannot, any more than the
  origin and determination of matter and force, be explained on
  purely material grounds, but involve the consideration of power
  referable to the unseen and spiritual world.</p>

  <p>Different minds may state these principles in different ways,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id=
  "Page_262">262</a></span> but I believe that in so far as
  pal&aelig;ontology is concerned, in substance they must hold
  good, at least as steps to higher truths. And now I may be
  permitted to add that we should be thankful that it is given to
  us to deal with so great questions, and that in doing so deep
  humility, earnest seeking for truth, patient collection of all
  facts, self-denying abstinence from hasty generalisations,
  forbearance and generous estimation with regard to our
  fellow-labourers, and reliance on that Divine Spirit which has
  breathed into us our intelligent life, and is the source of all
  true wisdom, are the qualities which best become us.</p>

  <p>As we have traced onward the succession of life, reference has
  been made here and there to the defects of those bold theories of
  descent with modification which are held forth in our time as the
  true bond of the links of the chain of life. It must have been
  apparent that these theories, however specious when placed in
  connection with a limited induction of facts selected for the
  purpose of illustrating them, are very far from affording a
  satisfactory solution of all difficulties. They cannot perhaps be
  expected to take us back to the origin of living beings; but they
  also fail to explain why so vast numbers of highly organised
  species struggle into existence simultaneously in one age and
  disappear in another, why no continuous chain of succession in
  time can be found gradually blending species into each other, and
  why in the natural succession of things degradation under the
  influence of external conditions and final extinction seem to be
  laws of organic existence. It is useless here to appeal to the
  imperfection of the record or to the movements or migrations of
  species. The record is now in many important parts too complete,
  and the simultaneousness of the entrance of the faunas and floras
  too certainly established, while the moving of species from place
  to place only evades the difficulty. The truth is that such
  hypotheses are at present premature, and that we require to have
  larger collections of facts. Independently of this, however, it
  would seem that from a philosophical <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span> point
  of view all theories of evolution, as at present applied to life,
  are fundamentally defective in being too partial in their
  character; and this applies more particularly to those which are
  &ldquo;monstic&rdquo; or &ldquo;agnostic,&rdquo; and thus
  endeavour to dispense with a Creative Will behind nature. It may
  be instructive to illustrate from the facts developed in
  preceding chapters this feature of most of the attempts at
  generalisation on this subject.</p>

  <p>First, then, these hypotheses are too partial, in their
  tendency to refer numerous and complex phenomena to one cause, or
  to a few causes only, when all trustworthy analogy would indicate
  that they must result from many concurrent forces and
  determinations of force. We have of late been very familiar with
  those ingenious, not to say amusing, speculations in which some
  entomologists and botanists have indulged with reference to the
  mutual relations of flowers and haustellate insects. Geologically
  the facts oblige us to begin with Cryptogamous plants and
  mandibulate insects; and out of the desire of insects for
  non-existent honey, and the adaptations of plants to the
  requirements of non-existent suctorial apparatus, we have to
  evolve the marvellous complexity of floral form and colouring,
  and the exquisitely delicate apparatus of the mouths of
  haustellate insects. Now when it is borne in mind that this
  theory implies a mental confusion on our part precisely similar
  to that which in the department of mechanics actuates the seekers
  for perpetual motion, that we have not the smallest tittle of
  evidence that the changes required have actually occurred in any
  one case, and that the thousands of other structures and
  relations of the plant and the insect have to be worked out by a
  series of concurrent evolutions so complex and absolutely
  incalculable in the aggregate that the cycles and epicycles of
  the Ptolemaic astronomy were child&rsquo;s play in comparison, we
  need not wonder that the common sense of mankind revolts against
  such fancies, and that we are accused of attempting to construct
  the universe by methods <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264"
  id="Page_264">264</a></span> that would baffle Omnipotence
  itself, because they are simply absurd. In this aspect of them,
  indeed, such speculations are necessarily futile, because no mind
  can grasp all the complexities of even any one case, and it is
  useless to follow out an imaginary line of development which
  unexplained facts must contradict at every step. This is also no
  doubt the reason why all recent attempts at constructing
  &ldquo;Phylogenies&rdquo; are so changeable, and why no two
  experts can agree about almost any of them.</p>

  <p>A second aspect in which such speculations are too partial is
  in the unwarranted use which they make of analogy. It is not
  unusual to find such analogies as that between the embryonic
  development of the individual animal and the succession of
  animals in geological time placed on a level with that reasoning
  from analogy by which geologists apply modern causes to explain
  geological formations. No claim could be more unfounded. When the
  geologist studies ancient limestones built up of the remains of
  corals, and then applies the phenomena of modern coral reefs to
  explain their origin, he brings the latter to bear on the former
  by an analogy which includes not merely the apparent results but
  the causes at work, and the conditions of their action; and it is
  on this that the validity of his comparison depends, in so far as
  it relates to similarity of mode of formation. But when we
  compare the development of an animal from an embryo cell with the
  progress of animals in time, though we have a curious analogy as
  to the steps of the process, the conditions and agents at work
  are known to be altogether dissimilar, and therefore we have no
  evidence whatever as to identity of cause, and our reasoning
  becomes at once the most transparent of fallacies. Farther, we
  have no right here to overlook the fact that the conditions of
  the embryo are determined by those of a previous adult, and that
  no sooner does this hereditary potentiality produce a new adult
  animal than the terrible external agencies of the physical world,
  in presence of which all life exists, begin to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span> tell on
  the organism, and after a struggle of longer or shorter duration
  it succumbs to death, and its substance returns into inorganic
  nature, a law from which even the longer life of the species does
  not seem to exempt it. All this is so plain and manifest that it
  is extraordinary that evolutionists will continue to use such
  partial and imperfect arguments. Another example may be taken
  from that application of the doctrine of natural selection to
  explain the introduction of species in geological time which is
  so elaborately discussed by Sir C. Lyell in the last edition of
  his <i>Principles of Geology</i>. The great geologist evidently
  leans strongly to the theory, and claims for it the
  &ldquo;highest degree of probability,&rdquo; yet he perceives
  that there is a serious gap in it; since no modern fact has ever
  proved the origin of a new species by modification. Such a gap,
  if it existed in those grand analogies by which we explain
  geological formations through modern causes, would be admitted to
  be fatal.</p>

  <p>A third illustration of the partial character of these
  hypotheses may be taken from the use made of the theory deduced
  from modern physical discoveries, that life must be merely a
  product of the continuous operation of physical laws. The
  assumption, for it is nothing more, that the phenomena of life
  are produced merely by some arrangement of physical forces, even
  if it be admitted to be true, gives only a partial explanation of
  the possible origin of life. It does not account for the fact
  that life as a force or combination of forces is set in
  antagonism to all other forces. It does not account for the
  marvellous connection of life with organisation. It does not
  account for the determination and arrangement of forces implied
  in life. A very simple illustration may make this plain. If the
  problem to be solved were the origin of the mariner&rsquo;s
  compass, one might assert that it is wholly a physical
  arrangement both as to matter and force. Another might assert
  that it involves mind and intelligence in addition. In some sense
  both would be right. The properties of magnetic force and of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id=
  "Page_266">266</a></span> iron or steel are purely physical, and
  it might even be within the bounds of possibility that somewhere
  in the universe a mass of natural loadstone may have been so
  balanced as to swing in harmony with the earth&rsquo;s magnetism.
  Yet we should surely be regarded as very credulous if we could be
  induced to believe that the mariner&rsquo;s compass has
  originated in that way. This argument applies with a thousandfold
  greater force to the origin of life, which involves even in its
  simplest forms so many more adjustments of force and so much more
  complex machinery.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, these hypotheses are partial, inasmuch as they fail
  to account for the vastly varied and correlated interdependencies
  of natural things and forces, and for the unity of plan which
  pervades the whole. These can be explained only by taking into
  the account another element from without. Even when it professes
  to admit the existence of a God, the evolutionist reasoning of
  our day limits itself practically to the physical or visible
  universe, and leaves entirely out of sight the power of the
  unseen and spiritual, as if this were something with which
  science has nothing to do, but which belongs only to imagination
  or sentiment. So much has this been the case that when recently a
  few physicists and naturalists have turned to this aspect of the
  subject, they have seemed to be teaching new and startling
  truths, though only reviving some of the oldest and most
  permanent ideas of our race. From the dawn of human thought it
  has been the conclusion alike of philosophers, theologians, and
  the common sense of mankind, that the seen can be explained only
  by reference to the unseen, and that any merely physical theory
  of the world is necessarily partial. This, too, is the position
  of our sacred Scriptures, and is broadly stated in their opening
  verse; and indeed it lies alike at the basis of all true religion
  and all sound philosophy, for it must necessarily be that
  &ldquo;the things that are seen are temporal, the things that are
  unseen, eternal.&rdquo; With reference to the primal aggregation
  of energy in the visible universe, with <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
  reference to the introduction of life, with reference to the soul
  of man, with reference to the heavenly gifts of genius and
  prophecy, with reference to the introduction of the Saviour
  Himself into the world, and with reference to the spiritual gifts
  and graces of God&rsquo;s people, all these spring not from
  sporadic acts of intervention, but from the continuous action of
  God and the unseen world; and this, we must never forget, is the
  true ideal of creation in Scripture and in sound theology. Only
  in such exceptional and little influential philosophies as that
  of Democritus, and in the speculations of a few men carried off
  their balance by the brilliant physical discoveries of our age,
  has this necessarily partial and imperfect view been adopted.
  Never indeed was its imperfection more clear than in the light of
  modern science.</p>

  <p>Geology, by tracing back all present things to their origin,
  was the first science to establish on a basis of observed facts
  the necessity of a beginning and end of the world. But even
  physical science now teaches us that the visible universe is a
  vast machine for the dissipation of energy; that the processes
  going on in it must have had a beginning in time, and that all
  things tend to a final and helpless equilibrium. This necessity
  implies an unseen power, an invisible universe, in which the
  visible universe must have originated, and to which its energy is
  ever returning. The hiatus between the seen and the unseen may be
  bridged over by the conceptions of atomic vortices of force, and
  by the universal and continuous ether; but whether or not, it has
  become clear that the conception of the unseen as existing has
  become necessary to our belief in the possible existence of the
  physical universe itself, even without taking life into the
  account.</p>

  <p>It is in the domain of life, however, that this necessity
  becomes most apparent; and it is in the plant that we first
  clearly perceive a visible testimony to that unseen which is the
  counterpart of the seen. Life in the plant opposes the outward
  rush of force in our system, arrests a part of it on its way,
  fixes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id=
  "Page_268">268</a></span> it as potential energy, and thus,
  forming a mere eddy, so to speak, in the process of dissipation
  of energy, it accumulates that on which animal life and man
  himself may subsist, and assert for a time supremacy over the
  seen and temporal on behalf of the unseen and eternal. I say, for
  a time, because life is, in the visible universe, as at present
  constituted, but a temporary exception, introduced from that
  unseen world where it is no longer the exception but the eternal
  rule. In a still higher sense, then, than that in which matter
  and force testify to a Creator, organisation and life, whether in
  the plant, the animal, or man, bear the same testimony, and exist
  as outposts put forth in the succession of ages from that higher
  heaven that surrounds the visible universe. In them, as in dead
  matter, Almighty power is no doubt conditioned by law, yet they
  bear more distinctly upon them the impress of their Maker, and
  while all explanations of the physical universe which refuse to
  recognise its spiritual and unseen origin must necessarily be
  partial and in the end incomprehensible, this destiny falls more
  quickly and surely on the attempt to account for life and its
  succession on merely materialistic principles.</p>

  <p>Here, however, we must remember that creation, as maintained
  against such materialistic evolution, whether by theology,
  philosophy, or Holy Scripture, is necessarily a continuous, nay,
  an eternal influence, not an intervention of disconnected acts.
  It is the true continuity, which includes and binds together all
  other continuity.</p>

  <p>It is here that natural science meets with theology, not as an
  antagonist, but as a friend and ally in its time of greatest
  need; and I must here record my belief that neither men of
  science nor theologians have a right to separate what God in Holy
  Scripture has joined together, or to build up a wall between
  nature and religion, and write upon it &ldquo;no
  thoroughfare.&rdquo; The science that does this must be impotent
  to explain nature and without hold on the higher sentiments of
  man. The theology that does this must sink into mere
  superstition.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span> In the light of all these
  considerations, whether bearing on our knowledge or our
  ignorance, a higher and deeper question presents itself, namely,
  that as to the relation of nature and of man to a Personal
  Creator. To this it seems to me that the study of the succession
  of life yields no uncertain reply. Call the progress of life an
  evolution if you will; trace it back to prim&aelig;val Protozoa,
  or to a congeries of atoms: still the truth remains that nothing
  can be evolved out of these primitive materials except what they
  originally contained. Now we find in the existence of man, and in
  the tendency of the scheme of nature towards his introduction,
  evidence that at least all that is involved in the reasoning and
  moral nature of man must have existed potentially before atoms
  began to shape themselves into crystals or into organic forms.
  Nay, more than this is implied, for we do not know that man and
  what he has hitherto been and done constitute the ultimate
  perfection of nature, and we must suspect that something much
  more than what we see in man must be required for the origination
  of the chain of life. What does this prove, in any sense in which
  human reason can understand it? Nothing less, it seems to me,
  than that doctrine of the Almighty Divine Logos, or Creative
  Reason, as the cause of all things, asserted in our sacred
  Scriptures, and held in one form or another by all the greatest
  thinkers who have attempted to deal with the question of origins.
  Falling back on this great truth, whether presented to us in the
  simple &ldquo;God said&rdquo; of Genesis, or in the more definite
  form of the New Testament, &ldquo;The Word was with God, and the
  Word was God,&rdquo; we find ourselves in the presence of a
  Divine plan pervading all the ages of the earth&rsquo;s history
  and culminating in man, who presents for the first time the image
  and likeness of the Divine Maker; and this forms the true nexus
  of all the separate chains of life. Had man never existed, such
  reasoning might have been speculative merely, but the existence
  of man, taken in connection with the progress of the plan which
  has terminated in his advent, proves the existence of God.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span> Divine revelation carries us a step
  farther, and teaches us to recognise in Jesus of Nazareth God
  manifest in the flesh, the Divine Logos dwelling among men. But
  though this is a doctrine of revelation and not of science, it is
  in perfect harmony with the plan of progress which we have been
  sketching. It is the natural outcome of a process leading to the
  introduction of a rational and accountable being, understanding
  something of the works and ways of God, that to him God should
  reveal Himself, and that the Divine Logos, by whom were
  &ldquo;constituted the ages&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id=
  "FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class=
  "fnanchor">94</a> of the world&rsquo;s geological history, should
  preside also over its future consummation, when all the
  degradation that has sprung from the aberrations of fallen and
  imperfect humanity shall be removed, and man himself shall become
  fully a partaker of the Divine nature.</p>

  <p>The world we live in is thus not necessarily a finished world,
  and it is now marred by the sins of man. What it may be in the
  future, we can perhaps as little guess as an intelligence
  studying the Pal&aelig;ozoic world could have understood that of
  the present time. But it is a glorious truth to know that our
  Maker has revealed Himself to us also as a Saviour, and that as
  individuals we shall not perish, to be replaced by an improved
  species in the future, but that we ourselves, as sons of God, may
  enter into and possess the new earth and new heavens of future
  &aelig;ons of the universe. Thus it would seem that the Gospel of
  Jesus Christ is that which was wanting to complete and justify
  the history of nature by bringing to light the final
  &ldquo;restitution of all things,&rdquo; and our own union to God
  in a happy immortality.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
